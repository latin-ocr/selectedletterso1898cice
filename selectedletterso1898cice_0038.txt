xxxii INTRODUCTION.

Epist. XLII., intr.) to the senate Jan. 1, 49 B.c., when the con-
suls L. Lentulus Crus and C. Claudius Marcellus assumed
office. Caesar’s proposals were not accepted, and a resolu-
tion was passed declaring that he would be acting adversus
rem publicam if he did not give up his army by July 1, 49 B.C.¹ 3
and on Jan. 7 the senatus consultum ultimum 2 was passed, upon
which the tribunes Antonius and Cassius,3 as well as Curio
and Caelius, set out for Caesar’s camp.

28. Cicero's position made him an eminently fit person
to effect a eompr01nise.‘¹ He proposed that Pompey should
go to Spain, and that Caesar should not be compelled to
attend his canvass in person ⁵ 3 but his efforts were fruitless.
On Jan. 10 Caesar crossed the Rubicon6 with five cohorts
and marched toward Rome, taking Pisaurum, Fanum, and
Ancona on his way. On Jan. 14 the senate passed the
decretum tumultus? but the news of Caesar's rapid advance
forced Pompey, the consuls, and senators to leave Rome,8
Jan. 17, and hurry southward.

29. Cicero left the city the same day. The senate had
assigned the Campanian district to him, but he saw that
little could be done,9 because the inhabitants of Campania
had many of them received their lands through Caesar's
law (ἓ 13). Furthermore he hoped for peace, and thought
that neutrality on his part would best fit him to act as
mediator between the opposing forces; and to maintain his
neutral position, he gave up his appointment in Campania
just before leaving the city, and took charge, in a civil capa-
city, of the Roman Campagna and the coast of Latium.¹⁰
