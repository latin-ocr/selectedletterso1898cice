28 CICERO'S LETTERS.

[Ep. V.

Sed senatus consulta duo iarn facta sunt odiosa, quod
in consulem facta putantur, Catone et Domitio postu-
lante: unum, ut apud magistratus inquiri liceret, alte-
rum, cuius domi divisores habitarent, adversus rem
publicam. Lurco autem tribunus pl„ qui magistratum
insimulatum lege Aelia iniit, solutus est et Aelia et
Fufia, ut legem de ambitu ferret, quam ille bono auspi-
cio claudus homo promulgavit. Ita comitia in a. d. VI
Kal. Sext. dilata sunt. Novi est in lege hoc, ut qui
nummos in tribubus pronuntiarit, si non dederit, im-
pune sit, sin dederit, ut, quoad vivat, singulis tribubus

non credo: the context would
indicate that Cicero did believe

the introduction of new laws. By
the postponement of the comitia

the story, and this saving clause
may have been added for sear
that the letter might be inter-
cepted. — Domitio: cf. Ep. Ι. 3 n.
—unum . . . alterurn: one, that
the houses of the magistrates
might be searched for professional
bribers or money to be used in
bribery; the other, that if bribery
agents were found at the house of
a magistrate, such a magistrate
should be considered guilty of an
offense against the public weal.
As the person of a magistrate
was inviolable during his term of
office, this was the only action
possible against him. Cf. Momm.
St. R. Ι. 705. —adversus rem
publicam: (sc. eum facere).

leges Aelia ct Fufia gave elections
precedence in point of time over

in order that Lurco might bring in
his bill, this section of the law
was suspended. Cf. Mommsen,
St. R. Ι. 83 and 111, n. 4. -magi-
stratum insimulatum lege Ae-
lia: one portion of the Aelian law,
passed about 155 B.C., apparently
for the first time gave to magis-
trates the right to take the aus-
pices before the meeting of the
concilium plebis, and, by announc-
ing them as unfavorable, to in-
terfere with the action of the
tribune who presided over this
assembly. Cf. Herzog, Ι. 419,
1163. By the Aelian law, there-
fore, Lurco’s own office was in-
simulatus. —bono auspicio clau-
dus homo: ironical. In early
days bodily infirmity debarred a
man from office altogether. The
proposal of a bill by a lame man,
therefore, scarcely augured well
for its success. -- quoad vivat: i.e.
every year for the rest of his life.

for sestertius and sestertium, de-
rived from IIS(emis)‚ as the ses-
tertius was worth 23- asses. The
