to Rome to take part in the meeting of the senate which
was called for Sept. 1.

40. He found matters however in a far less favorable
condition than he had hoped to find thern, and absented
himself from the meeting of the senate, Sept. 1, on the plea
of illness. Antony was angry at Cicero's absence and
threatened to tear his house down,l On the following day
Cicero appeared in the senate and delivered his first
Philippic.2 It was an outspoken criticism of Antony’s
action, but was free from personality. On Sept. 19 Antony
made a violent reply to Cicero's criticism.3

The province of Macedonia had at first been assigned
to Antony for the year 43‚4 but in June, in spite of the oppo-
sition of the senate, he secured the passage of a bill in the
comitia assigning to him Gallia Cisalpina, with Gallia Trans-
alpina perhaps, in place of Macedonia.5 He doubtless pre-
ferred Gallia Cisalpina, as it would enable him to remain
nearer Rome and because it was the key to Italy.⁶ He
left the city Nov. 28, hastening toward the north with three
legions and his body-guard to dispossess D. Brutus,⁷ to
whom Gallia Cisalpina had fallen under the arrangements
of Caesar.

unerring and his courage unfaltering. He saw that
Octavius must be attached to the senatorial party, and
Octavius was invested with the imperium and authorized,
in cooperation with the consuls of 43 Bc, to conduct the
war against Antony.⁸ He appreciated that at all hazards
