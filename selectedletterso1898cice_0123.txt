Att. 2. 19.] CICERO’S LETTERS. 41

rae Capuam ad Pompeium volare dicebantur. Inimici
erant equitibus qui Curioni stantes plauserant, hostes
omnibuS. Rosciae legi, etiam frumentariae minita-
bantur. Sane res erat perturbata. Equidem malueram
quod erat susceptum ab illis silentio transiri, sed vereor
ne non liceat. Non ferunt homines quod videturesse
tamen ferendum3 sed est iam una vox omnium, magis
odio firmata quam praesidio, Noster autem Publius
mihi minitatur, inimicus est3 impendet negotium, ad
quod tu scilicet advolabis. Videor mihi nostrum illum
consularem exercitum bonorum omnium, etiam satis
bonorum habere firmissimum. Pompeius significat stu-
dium erga me non mediocre; idem adfirmat verbum de
me illum non esse facturum, in quo non me ille fallit,
sed ipse fallitur.

are probably epistolary. Cf. Intr.
84 c.—equitibus qui, etc.: the
hostility of the equites toward Cae-
sar is hard to understand, as his
legislation to relieve the publi-
cani who had bid too high for the
privilege of collecting the taxes
(Att. 1. 17. 93 2. 16. 2) was calcu-
lated to win their favor. — Capu-
am: Pompey was at Capua as a
member of the commission ap-
pointed under Caesar’s agrarian
laws. —Rosciae legi: the lex Ro-
scia, proposed by L. Roscius Otho
in 67 B.C., set apart 14 rows of
seats for the knights immediately
behind the orchestra, where the
senators sat. This law had been
threatened in Cicero's consulship
also; cf. Att. 2. 1. 3 and Mommsen,
St. R. III. 52o.-frumentariae:
the lex Terentia et Cassia passed
in 73 B.C. fixed a low price for
corn. Cf. Cic. Verr. ii. 3. 163, 174.

The repeal of this law would be
aimed at the poor people‚ as the
repeal of the Roscian law would
injure the equites.—quam prae-
sidio: τῖε. than by power of re-
sistance.

4. noster: the possessive is
often thus used ironically in the
letters of one whom the writer
dislikes or despises. Cf. Intr. 88 b.
—impendet negotium: Clodius

wished to take vengeance upon ,

Cicero for the latter's evidence on
the trial for sacrilege, and for the
discomfiture which he had suffered
at his hands in the debate in the
senate (cf. Ep. V. 2 n). Cf. Intr. ·
14. — consularem exercitum : i.e.
the backing which Cicero's consul-
ship won him. —- illum (faetu-
rum): i.e. Clodius. —- in locum

member of Caesar's land commis-
