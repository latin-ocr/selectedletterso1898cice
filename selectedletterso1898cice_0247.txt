CICERO'S LETTERS. ⁷ · 165

Id quantis nostris peccatis vitiisque eve—

impendere putarem, scripseram ad te et iam tuas

litteras exspectabam.

XLVII. (Aa. 9. 6 A.)

CAESAR IMP. S. D. CICERONI IMP.

Cum Furnium nostrum tantum vidissem, neque loqui
neque audire meo commodo potuissem, properarem ¹
atque essem in itinere praemissis iam legionibus, prae-
terire'tamen non potui quin et scriberem ad te et
illum mitterem gratiasque agerem, etsi hoc et feci
saepe et saepius mihi facturus videor: ita de me mere-

ris,

Imprimis a te peto, quoniam confido me celeriter

ad urbem venturum, ut te ibi videam, ut tuo consilio
gratia dignitate ope omnium rerum uti possim. Ad

protected their own lives and prop-

enemies. This letter may be well
compared with Ep. XLVIII. 1.
XLVII. March 2-5, 49 3.(1.
The phrase essem in itinere in-
dicates that this letter was written
while Caesar was hastening to
Brundisium to intercept Pompey if
possible, before he should escape
from Italy. Caesar reached Brun-
disium Mar. 9 (Att. 9. 13 A. 1).
Cicero sent this letter to Atticus
with one of his own (cf. Att. 9. 66).
Furnium: an ex·tribune‚ and a
friend of Caesar and Cicero, to
whom Fam. 10. 25 and 26 are ad-
dressed- praeterire: Cicero was
still at Formiae. ——tuo consilio
. . . ope: Caesar made strenuous
efforts to induce Cicero to return

to Rome and lend him the benefit
of his influence, and Cicero kept
up a correspondence with him in
the hope of terminating the Civil
War. Three weeks later a con-
ference took place between them
(cf. Intr. 29 f.) which led Cicero
to give up all hope of a peaceful
settlement of the difficulty. Cf.
consilio, Ep. XLIX. 1 n. The pro-
posal which Caesar made in this
letter was left unanswered, since
Cicero was at this moment wait-
ing for some decisive news from
Brundisium (cf. Att. 9. 7. 5), and
also distrusted Caesar's purposes;
