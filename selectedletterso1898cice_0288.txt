Sed
hoc genere nihil opus est. Incolumem te cito, ut sperO,
vel potius, ut perspiciO, videbimus, Interea tibi absenti
et huic, qui adest, imagini animi et corporis tui, con-
stantissimo atque optimo filio tuo, studium officium
operam laborem meum iampridem et pollicitus sum et
detuli, nunc hoc ampliUS, quod me amicissime cotidie
magis Caesar amplectitur, familiares quidem eius sicuti
neminem. Apud quem quicquid valebo vel auctoritate
vel gratia, valebo tibi. Tu cura ut cum firmitudine te
animi tum etiam spe optima sustentes,

23 of the Julian calendar), 46 B.C.
Q. Ligarius was in 50 B.C. legate
in charge of the province of Africa.
XVhen in 49 B.C. the Pompeian
P. Attius Varus, who had formerly
been propraetor of Africa, ap-
peared in the province, Ligarius
delivered it over to him, and
assisted him later in maintaining
his position against L. Aelius Tu-

battle of Thapsus, in which Liga-
rius took part against Caesar, he
was captured by the Caesarians,
and in 46 B.C. was living in exile.
The combined efforts of Cicero
and the relatives of Ligarius had
thus far failed to secure his recall.
To prevent the success of the
movement in his behalf‚ Q. Tubero,
son of Aelius Tubero, brought a
charge de vi against him. In his
defense Cicero delivered an oration
(still extant), which made so deep
an impression upon Caesar, who
presided at the trial (cf. pro Lig.
37), that Ligarius was ultimately
recalled. He joined later the con-
spiracy against Caesar, and was
probably put to death under the
Second Triumvirate.
