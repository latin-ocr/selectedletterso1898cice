CICERO’S CORRESPONDENCE AND ITS FIRST PUBLICATION.

65. The earliest letter (Att. 1. 5) in the correspondence
was written in 68 ss.c.; the latest (Fam. 10. 24), a letter from
Plancus to Cicero, bears the date of July 28, 43 B.c. Cicero’s
last extant letter (Fam. 10. 29) was written July 6, 43 nc.
The correspondence with Atticus closes with Att. 16. 15 in
Dec. 44 B.c. The fact that the extant correspondence
stops several months before his death is probably due to
the circumstance that the attitude of Octavius changed in

the summer of 43 B.C.‚ and Cicero’s letters after that date
were not published because of the strictures they contained

‘upon the conduct of Octavius, The following tables indicate
the extant and lost collections of letters z
