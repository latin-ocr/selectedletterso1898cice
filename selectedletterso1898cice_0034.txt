xxviii INTRODUCTION.

and the time seemed to Pompey ripe for strengthening him-
self and humbling his rival. He was practically dictator in
Rome, and still retained his governorship of Spain, while

his rival, Caesar, was far away in Gaul, engaged with Ver-.
cingetorix, his bravest and ablest enemy, in a life and death ·

struggle‚¹ which might end with him as the Parthian cam-
paign had ended with Crassus.

After assuming office Pompey secured the passage of
laws imposing heavier penalties for bribery and violenee‚2
prolonging his proconsulship of Spain for five years,3 and
a law de iure magzssvtratzmmst providing that candidates for
office must appear in person a certain number of days before
the election‚ and that those who had held office in Rome
must wait five years before assuming the government of a
province. Caesar was, however, exempted from the opera-
tion of the first clause of this law by a special measure‚⁵ and
also by a provision unconstitutionally appended to the law
itself as an afterthought by Pompey.6 The second provision
in the law was, however, intended to bring Caesar low. Even
if he should succeed in securing an election to the consul-
ship, it would be easy, after his term of office had expired‚
to prosecute him and to convict him of using violence in
his candidacy for the consulship in 60 B.C.‚ under the new
law de vi, which was retroactive.
