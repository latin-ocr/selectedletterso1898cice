the senate to assign provinces to ex-officials who had not
yet held governorshipSOabroad. Cicero was one of the

, number, and to him the province of Cilicia was assigned in

Mar., 51 B.c., much against his will.1 He left Rome in the
early partos May‚² and, traveling by the way of Brundisium,
Athens, and Ephesus, reached Laodicea, the first city of his

discipline‚⁹ while the justice of his government enabled him
to augment his own troops with those of his allies. With this
combined force he took the field in September. The victory
