116 ⁴ C1CERo’s LETTERS. [Ep. XXXII.

Baulis embaeneticam facere et usque e0, ut ego mise-
rerer eiUS‚ esurire, non sum commotUS, et hoc menda-
ci0‚ si qua pericula tibi impenderent, ut defungeremur
optavi. Plancus quidem tuus Ravennaest, et magno
congiario donatus a Caesare nec beatus nec bene

instructus est. Tui politici libri omnibus vigent.

XXXII. (Fam. 13. 1.)

M. CICERO S. D. C. MEMMIO.

Etsi non satis mihi constiterat curn aliquane animi
mei molestia an potius libenter te Athenis visurus

Memmius was praetor in 58 B.C.‚
and in 57 went out as governor of

in exile. — embaeneticam : the
word which Caelius used is hope·

lessly lost. The meaning is that
Q. Pompeius has been reduced to
such a degree that he has been
obliged to take up with some mean
employment. See Crit. Append. —
defungeremur: sc. iis periculis.
— Plancus tuus, your friend
Plancus. Cf. noster, Ep. VII. 4 n.
T. Munatius Plancus, an enemy of
Cicero, also living in banishment.
— Ravennaest: the Mss. of Cic-
ero’s Letters offer several un-
doubted instances of erasis, eg.
leavemmest (z Ravennae est) here,
neglqgentiast (Fam. 8. 3. 1), com-
mentzzrz'ost (Fam. 8. 11. 4), stoma-
chost (Fam. 8. 13. 2). All the in-
stances cited here are in the letters
of Caelius, and harmonize perfectly
with the Plautine tone of his cor-
respondence. Cf. also benest (Bal-
bus, Atc'. 9. 7 B. 1 and Fam. ¹4-
15 -—- Ep. LVIII.). — tui poli-
tici libri omnibus vigent, your
work (ιιι civil gavernment is well
received on all sides. The de Re
Publica is meant. Cf. Ep. XXIII.

XXXII. Athens, between June

25 and July 6, 51 B.C. Gaius

Bithynia, where the poets Catullus
and Helvius Cinna were members
of his staff (cf. Cat. cc. 10 and
28, and for a sketch of Memmius
as an orator, Cic. Brut. 247.) He

belonged at that time to the party ’Ξ

of the Optimates, but later he
became a democrat‚ and in 54 was
supported by Caesar for the con-
sulship, but having made a dis-
graceful political bargain with the
consuls of that year (Att. 4. 15· 7),
was banished. At this time he
was living in Athens, and having
become the owner of the garden
and of the ruins of the house which
had belonged to Epicurus, he pro-
posed to pull the house down in
order to put up a dwelling of his
own. The Epicureans, greatly dis-
tressed‚ applied to Cicero through
Atticus to intercede with Memmius
in their behalf. Cicero, although
not on the best of terms with Mem-
mius, acceded to their request.
Nothing is known of the result of
his intercession.

As an example of Cicero’s skill

in handling a delicate subject‚this .
