xxvi INTRODUCTION.

Marcus could not but recognize the binding force of this
promise made in his behalf—made, though it was, in a
moment of weakness and despair. To this consideration
must also be added Cicero's positive gratitude for Pompey's
services in securing his recall, and his recognition of the
power of the triumvirs to punish him severely if he persisted
in his independent course. Cicero withdrew his motion,1
and, for the next five years, gave up all opposition to the

office, secured the passage of laws assigning Spain to
