CICERO‘S LETTERS.

l Fam. 11. 9.] 281

sperent se convalescere posse. Ego ne consistere
possit in Italia Antonius dabo operam. Sequar eum
confestim. Vtrumque me praestaturum spero ne aut
Ventidius elabatur aut Antonius in Italia moretur. In
primis rogo te ad hominem ventosissimum Lepidum
mittas, ne bellum nobis redintegrare possit Antonio
sibi coniuncto; narn de Pollione Asinio puto te per·
spicere quid facturus sit. Multae et bonae et firmae
sunt legiones Lepidi et Asini. Neque haec idcirco 2
tibi scribO, quod te non eadem animadvertere sciam,
sed quod mihi persuasissimumst Lepidum recte fac-
turum numquam, si forte vobis id de hoc dubium est.
Plancum quoque confirmetis om, quem spero pulso
Antonio rei p. non defuturum. Si se Alpes Antonius

jealousy which the senate excited
in Octavius by conferring the chief
command upon D. Brutus, led to
his withdrawal from the campaign.
—praestatururn . . . ne ε a con-
struction not found in Cicero (cf,
however, praestare ut, de Or. 1.
44), but used by Caelius (Fam. 8. 10.
5), and Cassius (Fam. 12. 13. 4).
—Ventidius: P. Ventidius Bassus
with three legions joined Antony
May 3 at Vada Sabatia—vento-
sissimurn: used metaphorically
as in Cic. Philipp. 11. 17; Hor.
Ep. 1. 8. 12. — Lepidum: M.
Aemilius Lepidus, who had been
consul in 46 B.C., was now gover-
nor of Gallia Narbonensis and
Hispania Citerior. He became a
member of the Second Triumvirate
a few months later. —mittas: ap-
parently Cicero complied with this
request, as about three weeks later
Lepidus wrote to him (Fam. 10.
34 and 34 Α), describing the state
of affairs in the North, adding
quod ad bellum hoc attinet, nec se-
natui nec rei publicae deerimus

(Fam. 10. 34. 2).— de Pollione Asi-
nio : C. Asinius Pollio was ‘gov-
ernor of Hispania Vlterior. True
to that tendency which in after life
kept him from an active participa-
tion in politics, he was at present
holding aloof from the struggle
about Mutina. Later he joined
Antony. In after life he is known
to us as the friend of Vergil and
Horace, and the liberal patron of
art and literature. Three of his
letters to Cicero are extant (Fam.
10. 31—33). His poems and histori-
cal writings are lost. On the order
of the nomen and cognomen,cf. Galli
Canini, Ep. XIX. 4 n. On de, see
Intr. 9r.—quid facturus sit: a
suspicion of the loyalty of Pollio
to the senate is suggested—mul-
tae . . . legiones: Lepidus had
seven, Pollio three, legions.

2. persuasissimumst: cf. Intr.
82 (end). —id de hoc dubium
est : a harsh expression, but the
style of 1). Brutus lacks polish.—
si . . . traiecerit : cf. Plancus in
Cic. Fam. 10. 9. 3 exercitum . . .
