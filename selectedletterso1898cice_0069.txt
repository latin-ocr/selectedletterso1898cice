of his feeling was reflected, not merely in the thought
expressed, but in the form in which it found expression.

73. The student of Plautus, of Terence, of Horace in his
Satires, and of Petronius, will find, as might be expected,
many points of contact between the language of these writers
and the language of the Letters, with such differences in gen-
eral as result from the influences just noted. It is interest-

in the Letters is the diminutive. The diminutive ending is
