lxviii INTRODUCTION. .

is but a single example of ne with the indefinite second
person present subjunctive in a prohibition’1; and that,
furthermore, prohibitions expressed by ne with the present
or the perfect subjunctive, lack the dignity of the-nolzsscon-
struction, and are consequently confined to informal Latin.²
Quite naturally, therefore, many of these prohibitions
expressed by ne with the present subjunctive„ and the
majority of those expressed by ne with the perfect subjunc-
tive, to be found in classical prose, are in the correspond-
ence of Cicero,3 and twelve of the fourteen cases of the last—
mentioned construction, which is the more colloquial of the
two, occur in letters to Cicero’s most familiar correspond-
ents, e.g. ‘ tlc, 772cllmn,' z'nquz'eS, ‘actum ne agas' (Att. 9. 18. 3);
iocum autem illins de sua egestate ne sis aspernatus (Q. fr.
2. 10 (12). 5).

(c) The so-called epistolary use of tlte tenses is the com-
monest peculiarity in the use of tenses to be found in
the Letters. The writer of the letter imagines himself in
the place of the recipient, and therefore uses a tense of past
time in speaking of an event which was exactly or approxi-
mately contemporaneous with the writing of the letter.
This usage is most frequent with verbs indicating the writ-
ing of a letter, or the sending of a letter or messenger,4 as
ego tibi aliquid de meis scrzffitis mittam .· ηἱΙιίί erat absoluti
(Att. 1. 16. 18), quae milei veniebant in mentem, quae ad te
pertinere arbitrabar, qnod in Ciliciam prcficiscebczr, existimavi
me ad te oportere scribere (Fam. 2. 18. 3). Cf. also note to
prcffectz' sumus, Epist. XI. 3.
