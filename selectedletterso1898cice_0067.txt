INTRODUCTION. lxi

the familiar intercourse of everyday life, as opposed to
the more formal diction adopted in literary compositions
intended for a more general audience or body of readers.

70. Formal and informal Latin, if they may be so desig-
nated, are in their origin independent of one another. At
the moment when Latin literature began, inasmuch as differ-
ences in culture did not exist, there was but one Latin
spoken by patrician and plebeian alike. With the appear-
ance of literature, Latin developed along two different lines.
The poets, especially Ennius, in adapting Latin to literary
purposeS, adopted certain words and forms of expression
and rejected others. On the other hand, the people‚ in their
daily life, were more conservative, retaining much of that
which literature rejected,l while at the same time they
adopted many new forms of expression which formal litera-
ture either did not employ at all or accepted at a later date.
In particular these literary pioneers, being steeped in Greek
literature, unconsciously sought to develop literary Latin
in accordance with the genius of the Greek language. This
latter infiuence acted only indirectly upon colloquial speech.

71. The cleft thus resulting continued to widen, until, in
course of time, certain distinct and interesting differences
are noticeable between formal and informal Latin. Of
course important differences are found only between the
extremes of these two forms of speech. Cicero himself inti-
mates that we may expect to find in his letters evidences of
colloquialism, for he writes to his friend Paetus (Fam. 9. 21.
Ι) : Quid tibi ego videor in epistulis? norme plebeio sermone
agere tecum? . . . epistulas vero cotidz'cznzs verbis texere
solemus,²

this sermo cotidianus as it is used in letter writing. Some
