64 CICERo’s LETTERS. [Ep. xv.

et Afranium. Factum est senatus consultum in meam
sententiam, ut cum Pompeio ageretur ut eam rem sus-
ciperet lexque ferretur3 quo senatus consulto recitato,
continUO‚ cum more hoc insulso et novo plausum meo
nomine recitando dedissent, habui contionem3 omnes
magistratus praesentes praeter unum praetorem et duos
tribunos pl. dederunt. Postridie senatus frequenS, et
ornnes consulares nihil Pompeio postulanti negarunt.
Ille legatos quindecim cum postularet, me principem
nominavit et ad omnia me alterum se fore dixit. Legem
consules conscripserunt, qua Pompeio per quinquennium
omnis potestas rei frumentariae toto orbe terrarum da-
retur; alteram MessiuS, qui omnis pecuniae dat potesta-

nius, cf. Aulifilius, Ep. V. 12 n. —
eam rem: i.e. the procuringof corn.
—meo nomine: Cicero had been
a leading advocate of the bill, so
that his name probably appeared
in the list of those who put it
into legal form3 cf. note on legem
. . . conscripserunt below.—- reci-
tando: here, as frequently in Livy
(eg. 25. 30. 6) and occasionally in
Tacitus, the ablative of the ge-
rundive takes the place of the miss-
ing pres. part. pass—praetorem:
the praetor was Appius Claudius
Pulcher, the brother of Clodius.
Cf. Ep. VIII. 2. The two trib-
unes, Sex. Atilius Serranus and
Q. Numerius Rufus, had already
opposed Cicero in other matters.
Cf. Cic. pro Sest. 72, 94.—dede-
runt (sc. contionem): a contio was
either an assembly of the people
held to consider a question but
not to vote upon it, or a speech
delivered before such an assembly.
Only a magistrate could give a
private citizen the right of speak-
ing in a contio, and the technical
phrase for such permission was

contionem dare or in contionem
producere. ·

7. senatus frequens (sc.ficz't):
cf. fi‘equentissimo senatu, Ep.
VI. 9 n.—alterum se: cf. vide
quam milei persuaserim te me esse
alterum, Ep. XXI. 1, and verus
amicus est tanquam alter idem,
chel. So. -legem . . . conscrip—
serunt: the senate voted upon a
general proposition or upon a num-
ber of propositions laid before it.
If a motion was adopted, it was
written out in legal form, after its
passage, by a committee containing
the leading representatives of the
party which had supported it. It
contained, when thus drawn up, the
title, the year, the day. the place
of meeting, the name of the pro-
poser and of those who witnessed
the drawing up of the bill, and
then the enacting clause or clauses,
with sometimes an indication of
the number present. For a sena-
tus consultum in legal form, cf.
Allen, Remnants of Early Latin,
Nos. 32, 1053 Cic. Ezm. 8. 8. 5. Cf.
also Willems, II. 206-216.— Mes-
