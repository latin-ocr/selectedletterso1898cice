vidisse te mallem. Nam quod est molestiae, non sane
multo levius est, cum te non videO, quod esse potuit
voluptatis certe, si vidissem te, plus fuisset. Itaque
non dubitabo dare operam ut te videam, cum id satis
commode facere potem. Interea quod per litteras et

a te illud primum rogabo ne quid invitus mea causa

Athens, June 25. The longest
stop on the way was a halt of three
weeks at Brundisium.

letter may be compared with the
one to Lucceius (Ep. XVIII.). The
case was beset with difficulties.

Memmius had been banished, un-
justly as he thought, at the mo-
ment when he was suing for the
consulship. He was now passing
a disappointed life in exile, and
was so far estranged from Cicero
that he had gone to Mytilene to
avoid him. He had been annoyed
by the importunity of the Epicu-
reans, for whom at the best he had
apparently great contempt, in spite
of the fact that Lucretius had dedi-
cated to him the de Rerum lVatura,
and his selfish nature brooked no
interference with his plans. Finally,
Patro, the leader of the Epicurean
school, was personally distasteful
to him.

Cicero’s itinerary from Minturnae
to Athens was as follows : Cumae,
Beneventum, May 1 1; Venusia,
May 14; Tarentum, May 18; Brun-
disium, May 22; Actium, June 143

1. non satis, etc.: before Cicero
reached Athens—te . . . visurus
essem: Memmius had withdrawn
to Mitylene, to avoid meeting Cic-
ero (Att. 5. 11. 6), because the
latter had been unwilling to de-
fend him against the charge of
ambitus.—iniuria: although the
banishment of Memmius was de-
served, technically it was iniuria,
because, as Memmius had turned
state⁷s evidence, and had brought
a charge of ambitus against Cn.
Domitius Calvinus (er. 3. 2. 3),
he might have reasonably expected
exemption from punishment.

2. curn Patrone . . . sunt,
Patro and l are quite devoted to
one another. Patro was at the
head of the Epicurean school in
Athens. Cicero was an adherent
of the Academy, and had little in
common with the Epicuream.—
