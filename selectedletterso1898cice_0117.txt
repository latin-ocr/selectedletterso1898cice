CICERO’S LETTERS. 35

Att. 1. 17.]

et abs te aliquanto ante testificata tua voluntas omit-
tendae provinciae, ut quod una non estis non dissensi-
one ac discidio vestro, sed voluntate ac iudicio tuo fac-
tum esse videatur. Quare et illa quae violata expia-

suam religionem obtinebunt. Nos hic in re publica 8
infirma misera commutabilique versamur. Credo enim
te audisse nostros equites paene a senatu esse diiunc-
tos3 qui primurn illud valde graviter tulerunt, promul-
gatum ex senatus consulto fuisse ut de eis qui ob iudi-
candum accepissent quaereretur. Qua in re decer-
nenda cum ego casu non adfuissem sensissemque id
equestrem ordinem ferre moleste neque aperte dicere,
obiurgavi senatum, ut mihi visus sum, summa cum auc-

not to go to Asia, and had proba-
bly based his refusal upon his
well-known pdlicy of keeping out
of politics (cf. Ep. V. 14). These
facts would absolve Atticus from
the charge of cherishing any ill-
will toward Quintus—et illa . . .
et haec nostra: the letter up to
this point consists of two distinct
parts; in the first part (1—4) the
relations existing between Atticus
and Quintus are discussed‚ in the
second part (5—7) the relations
between Atticus and Marcus Cic-
ero. A third division of the letter,
devoted to politics‚ begins with 8.

8. ob iudicandum: this sena-
torial investigation was directed
particularly against the jury in the
Clodian trial, the majority of
which was supposed to have been
bribed (cf. Ep. V. 5). Cato, who
proposed the investigation (cf. Att.
2. 1. 8), was acting simply in the
interests of justice; but, as many
of the suspected jurors were equi-

tes, the equestrian order regarded
the investigation as a covert attack
upon themselves, which at the
same time they could not oppose
(neque aperte dicere) without
appearing to defend crime. The
incident offers an excellent oppor-
tunity to contrast the methods of
Cato and of the politica] group to
which he belonged, with those of
Cicero and his school. Cato wishes
to punish the offenders regardless
of the political consequences, or,
as Cicero puts it (Att. 2. 1. 8), dicit
. . . tamquam z‘n Platonis πολιτείᾳ,
non tamquam in Romuli faece sen-
tentiam. Cicero abhors the deed,
but does not wish to punish the
evil-doers, for fear of alienating
the class to which they belonged,
and thus weakening the opposition
to the democracy. Cf. Att. 2. 1. 8
(end). Cato prevailed. —- accepis-
sent: used absolutely, as in Att. 5.
21. 5 and 1 1. 22. 2. Ordinarilypecu-
niam is expressed. Cf.Crit.Append.
