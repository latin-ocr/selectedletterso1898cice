Fam. 15. 4.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 123

usuris et falso aere alieno liberavi. Cumque ante
adventum meum seditione quadam exercitus esset dis-
sipatUS, quinque cohortes sine legam, sine tribuno,
militum, denique etiam sine centurione ullo, apud Philo-
melium consedissent, reliquus exercitus esset in Lyca-
onia, M. Anneio legato imperavi ut eas quinque cohortes
ad reliquum exercitum duceret, coactoque in unum
locum exercitu castra in Lycaonia apud Iconium face-
ret. Quod cum ab illo diligenter esset actum, ego in
castra a. d. V11 K. Sept. veni, cum interea superioribus
diebus ex s. c. et evocatorum firmam manum et equita-
tum sane idoneum et populorum liberorum regumque
sociorum auxilia voluntaria comparavissem. Interim
cum exercitu lustrato iter in Ciliciam facere coepissem

lessly in debt‚ were required at
great expense to send envoys to
Rome to thank the senate for the
beneficent government of the mon-
ster Appius (Fam. 3. 8. 2 f). Cae-
lius had the hardihood to ask
Cicero to levy a tax upon the pro-
vincials to pay for the games which
he was to give at Rome as a can-
didate for the aedileship (Ep.
XXXV. 21). — gravissimis usu-
ris: cf. Intr. 23.—falso aere
alieno, from a debt fraudulently
charged against them. Cicero re-
lates in Att. 5. 21. 12 a flagrant
instance of the kind, where a
money-lender‚ Scaptius by name,
a financial agent of M. Brutus
(Att. 5. 21. 10), tried to extort
200 talents from the people of
Salamis in Cyprus, who owed him
only 106.—M. Anneio legato:
cf. 8 n.-—apud Iconium: apud
with the acc. for the locative or in
with the abl. is archaic; cf. eg.
apud aedem Duelonai in the sena-
tus consultum de Bacchanalibus.
The expression is here used as a

set form of speech for a military
report; cf. apud Issum, Fam. 2.
10. 3. It is also preserved with
certain words in colloquial Latin.
In this case, as in many others,
colloquial Latin and official Latin
preserved forms of expression after
they had disappeared elsewhere, as
colloquial and official (especially
legal) English preserve certain
otherwise obsolete phrases. Silver
Latin, straining after novelties‚
brought this, as well as many
other archaisms, into use again3

3. a. d. V11 K. Sept.: Aug 24.
Under the pre-Julian calendar
August had 29 days.—-evocato-
rum: veterans who had served
their time, but might be called
upon for volunteer service, enj0y-
ing therein certain privileges.—
auxilia: usuallylight-armed troops.
— exercitu lustrato: Cicero had
14,ooo men; cf. Att. 5. 18. 2; 6.
