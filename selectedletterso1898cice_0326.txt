LXXXIII. Puteoli, Dec. 19,
45 B.C. This letter describes a
visit which Caesar, accompanied
by his bodyguard‚ <made at Cic-
ero's villa near Puteoli.

1. o . . . ἀμεταμέλητον, would
you believe z't, l leave nothing to be
sorry for in tlte visit of a guest so
formidable to me! The acc. hospi-
tem expresses astonishment.—
tam gravem: so formidable be-
cause he had been a political
enemy. mihi tam gravem is to
be taken parenthetically, and a
contrast is intended between gra-
vem and ἀμεταμέλητον. —fuit
enirn periucunde: sc. Caesar.
Cf. Intr. 85. Cicero addresses
almost the same words to Caesar
(pro Deiot. 19): cum in convivio
comiter et iucunde fuisses. On the
force of per, cf. Intr. 77. — sed,
but (to my tale). Breaking off his
general comments upon the inci-
dent, he proceeds to describe it in

detail. — secundis Saturnalibus: Ι

ιζε. Dec. 18.- Philippum: cf.
Ep. LXXII. n.—quippe homi-
nurn Clo 010: sc. suenum—po-
stridie : when he expected a visit
from Caesar.—- Barba Cassius:
cf. Galli Canini, Ep. XIX. 4 n.
Cassius Barba was a friend of
Caesar; cf. Philipp. 13. 3.— ille: ele.
Caesan- apud Philippum: sc.
erat.— Balbo: Cornelius Balbus,
Caesar’s financial agent. Cf. Ep.
XXI. 2 n. — in balneum: sc. ivit.
This was doubtless at Cicero’s
villa. With these words the ac-
count of the visit proper begins,
and since no reference is made to
Caesar’s arrival or to his recep-
tion by Cicero, Boot suggests with
probability that one or more lines
have fallen out after post h. V111.
——de Mamurra: Mamurra had
been Caesar’s praefectus fabrum
in Gaul and Britain. It is he
against whom Catullus directs his
fierce invectives‚ Car. 29 and 57.
The reference here is possibly to
