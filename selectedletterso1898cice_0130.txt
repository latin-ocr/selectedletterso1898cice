48 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. X.

strae consanguineus non mediocres terrores iacit atque
denuntiat, et Sampsiceramo negat, ceteris prae se fert
et ostentat. Quamobrem, si me amas tantum quantum
profecto amaS, si dormiS‚ expergiscere, si staS‚ ingre-
dere, si ingrederis, curre, si curriS‚ advola. Credibile
non est quantum ego in consiliis ets prudentia tua, quod-
que maximum est, quantum in amore et fide ponam,
Magnitudo rei longam orationem fortasse desiderat,
coniunctio vero nostrorum animorum brevitate con-
tenta est. Permagni nostra interest te, si comitiis non

potueris, at declarato illo esse Romae. Cura ut valeas,

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Miseriae nostrae potius velim quam inconstantiae
tribuaS, quod a Vibone quo te arcessebamus subito

nostrae: cf. noster, Ep. VII. 4 n.
Clodia had at one time hoped to
attract Cicero by her charms, „and
her hatred of him was partly due
to the failure of her efforts.— si
comitiis (esse Romae) non potue-
ris: the elections were to take place
Oct. 18 (cf. Att. 2. 20. 6), but the
tribunes did not enter on the duties
of their office until December 10.

Cicero's urgent requests for the
presence of Atticus would seem
to have been successful, as there
is a break in the correspondence
between the two men from No-
vember, 59, to March, 58, during
which time Atticus was doubtless
in Rome.

The correspondence of the year
59 ΒΕ. reveals the utter helpless-
ness of the senatorial party to eope
with the triumvirs. The former
were without a ‘platform ' and with-

out leaders. The petulant oppo-
sition of Bibulus and the tact-
less obstinacy of Cato excited only
ridicule and anger. These letters
as a whole disclose also Cicero’s
lack of political insight in failing
utterly to appreciate the strength
of the Triumvirate, and in failing
to see up to the last moment the
danger of his own position (cf.
also Intr. 14). In striking contrast
to the letters of this year are those
written six months later.

X. Vibo, about April 12, 58 B.c.
The letters of this third book,
ad ΑΜ, written in exile, expose
perhaps more than any other por-
tion of his correspondence, the
weak side of Cicero's character.
He is unmanly‚ selfish, and un-
grateful. In contrast the letters
of 44 and 43 B.C. breathe a spirit
of unfailing courage and unselfish
