158 CICERo’s LETTERS. [Ep. XLV.

et boni civis esse in ea urbe, in qua cum summis hono-
ribus imperiisque usus sit, res maximas gesserit, sacer-
dotio sit amplissimo praeditUS, non futurus sit qui
fuerit, subeundumque periculum sit cum aliquo fore
dedecore, si quando Pompeius rem publicam recipe-
rarit. In hac parte haec sunt; vide nunc quae sint
in altera. Nihil actum est a Pompeio nostro sapienter,
nihil fortiter3 addo etiam, nihil nisi contra consilium
auctoritatemque meam. Omitto illa vetera, quod istum
in rem publicam ille aluit, auxit, armavit, ille legibus
per vim et contra auspicia ferendis auctor, ille Galliae
ulterioris adiunctor‚ ille gener, ille in adoptando P. Clo-
dio augur, ille restituendi mei quam retinendi studio-

by defending some of Caesar’s
friends. — summis honoribus
imperiisque: τῖε. as praetor and
consul. The connection precludes
any reference to the military im-
perium which he had just held as
proconsul.—— sacerdotio: cf. Ep.
XXXIV. 13 n. The most plausi-
ble conjecture for the emendation
of this passage is to insert sit qui
fuerit with Lehmann. The mean-
ing then is : ‘ whether it is proper
for a brave man and a good citi-
zen to remain in a city in which,
after enjoying the most exalted
positions of honor and power,
. . . he will not be the man he
was, and must undergo the risk
of bringing some shame upon
himself, etc.' See Crit. Append.
—fore: in apposition to and ex-
planatory of periculum. Ne with
the subj. would be 3 more natural
construction, but cf. de Or. 2. 334
cum subest ille timor, ea (utilitate)
m’glecta ue dzgrm'tatem quidem posse
retineri. The statement of one
side of the question, which began
with 2, comes to an end with this
sentence.

3. istum : zie. Caesarem.- ille τ
2'.e. Pompeium—legibus . . . fe·-
rendis: i.e. the laws whose pas-
sage Caesar effected in his con-
sulship in 59 B.C. For Pompey’s
attitude toward these laws, cf. Att.
2. 16. 2. When Caesar's agrarian
law, assigning lands to Pompey's
veterans‚ carne before the people‚
Bibulus and Cato, the leaders of
the opposition‚ were treated with
great roughness; cf. Plut. Cat.
Asin. 32 3 Suet. Iul. 20.——contra
auspicia: to the many attempts
which the Optimates made to
postpone the comitia on religious
grounds (cf. Dio Cass. 38. 6)
Caesar paid little heed. — Galliae

. adiunctor: Caesar's third
province (cf. Intr. 13) was volun-
tarily added by the senate, proba-
bly through the influence of Pom-
pey. —— gener: sc. by his marriage
to Caesar's daughter Julia.—-i11e
. . . augur: Pompey was present
at the nieeting of the comitia curi-
ata when Clodius was adopted,
and, as augur, could have pre-
vented the adoption. Cf. Att. 2.
