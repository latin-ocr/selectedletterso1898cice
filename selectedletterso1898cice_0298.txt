CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. LXX.

constabat. Hoc tu pro tua sapientia feres aequo
animo ; quamquam πρόσωπον πόλεως amisimus, Cae-
sarem putabant moleste laturum, verentem ne hasta
refrixisset, Mindius macellarius et Attius pigmen-
tarius valde gaudebant se adversarium perdidisse. De
Hispania novi nihil, sed exspectatio valde magna3
Pansa noster palu-
datus a. d. 111 K. Ian. profectus est, ut quivis intelle-
gere posset, id quod tu nuper dubitare coepisti, τὸ
καλὸν δι’ αὑτὸ αἱρετὸν esse; narn quod multos miseriis
levavit et quod se in his malis hominem praebuit,
mirabilis eum virorum bonorum benevolentia prose-

rumores tristiores, sed ἀδέσποτοι.

ple do not care (to know how he
died), as long as they know he is
dead.' There is probably, as Reid
suggests, a double meaning in
combustum. Comburere is used
literally of burning a man's body
upon a funeral pyre, as in A tt. 14.
10. 1, and figuratively of ‘ roasting ’
a man in the courts‚ as our slang
phrase has it. Cf. Q.fr. 1. 2. 6
deinde rogas Fabium ut et patrem
et filium vivos comburat, si possit ,·
si minus, ad te mittat uti iudicio
comburantur. — hoc tu, etc. : Cas-
sius replied (Fam. 15. 19. 3) cuius
(i.e. Sullae) ego mortem forti mer-

cules animo tuli. — πρόσωπον πό-,

λεως, α familiar face in tlte city. —
ne hasta refrixisset: a hasta
stuck in the ground was the sign
of an auctiori. Sulla gained pos-
session at such sales of many
estates confiscated by Caesar ; cf.
Fam. 15. 19. 3 Sulla . . . omnia
bona coemit. This fact caused his
unpopularity. Cicero speaks of
his death in the same way in writ-
ing to Dolabella (Fam. 9. 10. 3):
ego ceteroqui animo aequo fero ,·
unum vereor ue lcaslcz Caesaris
refrixerit. Upon refrixisset, cf.

Intr. 99.—Mindius . . . perdi-
disse: the butcher Mindius and
the perfumer Attius have now no
competitor at auction sales.

3. de Hispania: upon de, cf.
Intr. 91. Caesar went to Spain
(cf. Bell. Ilz'sp. 2) in Nov., 46 B.C.,
and the battle of Munda took
place Mar. 17, 45, τῖε. only a few
months after this letter was
written. The difficulties in which
Caesar was involved, and the im-
minence of the decisive contest,
were doubtless known at Rome.
——Pansaz C. Vibius Pansa, the
colleague of Hirtius in the con-
sulship in 43. He had set out to
joiri Caesar in Spain3 cf. Schmidt,
Briefw. 272. — paludatus: of a
soldier, as togatus is used of
a civilian. The paludamentum
was the cloak of a commander,
'the sagum the cloak of a common
soldier. -—- nuper : Cassius had
lately become an Epicurean3 cf.
Fam. 15. 16. 1.-τὸ καλὸν δι’
αὑτὸ ciperem: a Stoic doctrine
which the Epicureans rejected.
Cassius's analysis of Pansa’s con-
duct is : Pansa, qui ἡδονὴν sequitur,
virtatem retinet, Ezm. 1 5. 19. 3.
