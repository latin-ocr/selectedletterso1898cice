Att. 1. 16.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 27

et iucunda consuetudine coniuncti inter nos sumUS,
usque e0, ut nostri isti comissatores coniurationiS,
barbatuli iuveneS, illum in sermonibus Cn. Ciceronem
appellent. Itaque et ludis et gladiatoribus mirandas
ἐπισημασίας sine ulla pastoricia fistula auferebamus
Nunc est exspectatio comitiorum, in quae omnibus invi-
tis trudit noster Magnus Auli filium, atque in eo neque
auctoritate neque gratia pugnat, sed quibus Philippus
omnia castella expugnari posse dicebat in quae modo
asellus onustus auro posset ascendere; consul autem
ille deterioris histrionis similis suscepisse negotium
’ dicitur et domi divisores habere, quod ego non credo,

had indulged in this caustic ar-
raignment of Pompey: nihil come,
nihil simplex, m'lzz'l ἐν τοῖς πολιτι-
κοῖς illustre, nihil honestum, nihil
sorte, nihil liberum (A tt. 1. 13. 4).
—isti comissatores coniuratio-
nis, tlcose wlzo conspired only ove7
their wine-caps (Tyrrell).—bar-
batuli: Caelius, Dolabella, Curio
filius, Clodius, etc. Cf. note to
pulchellus, 1o.— Cn. Ciceronem:
the nickname given to Pompey
may suggest that he was as vacil-
lating as Cicero in his actions, as
Mommsen explains it, or that the
friendship between Cicero and
Pompey was so close as to make
them one. —ludis et gladiatori-
bus: colloquial ablatives of time.
Cf. Intr. 83 d. Such colloquial
ablatives Cicero has with one ex-
ception (Philipp. 9. 16) avoided
outside the letters. The ludi re-
ferred to were probably the ludi
lllezgrzzletzses in April. —— ἐπισημα.-
σίαςε these indications of popu-
larity were probably given when
Cicero and Pompey entered while
the games were being held. For a
similar scene when Caesar and
Curio entered the theatre‚ cf. Ep.

· VII. 3.— pastoricia fistula: shrill

whistles were used by a politician’s
opponents to drown the applause
of his supporters. Hissing was
also common (Ep. VII. 2).

12. comitiorum: the consular
election.— Auli filium: yle. L.
Afranius. By designating him as
Auli filiurn Cicero means perhaps
that Afranius was himself a man of
no worth. He was consul in 60
B.C., proconsul of Gallia Cisal-
pina in 59 B.C.‚ was pardoned by
Caesar for espousing the cause of
Pompey in the Civil VVar, joined
the Pompeian forces again, and was
captured and put to death after the
battle of Thapsus.-— Philippus:
the methods of Philip of Macedon
had become proverbial. Cf. Hor.
Od. 3. 16. 1 3-1 5 diffidit urbium por-
tas vir sllacedo et subruit aemulos
reges muneribus. In Juv. 12. 47 he
is callidas emptor Olynthi. —— con-
sul . . . ille: zle. Piso—deterio-
ris histrionis: a δευτεραγωνιστής.
Pompey takes the leading r61e in
this comedy of the election of Afra-
nius, and the consul Piso plays the
second part. — divisores ε men
to distribute money. —quod ego
