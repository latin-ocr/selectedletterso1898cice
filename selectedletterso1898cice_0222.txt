—monurnentum: τῖε. something
to commemorate himself in con-
nection with Athens, although he
cannot endure the thought of hav-
ing his name attached to some
one of the famous statues of other
men in Athens, a practice which

some Romans had followed.—
mysteria: the festival of the
Bona Dea, which occurred in May.
The mention of Bona Dea brings
up to Cicero's mind the celebrated
sacrilege of Clodius (cf. Ep. V.)‚
with its long train of disasters for
him, and leads him to date his
letter from the day of Clodius's
murder by Milo. To this event
Cicero jestingly gives the name
of pugna Leuctrica, for, as Greece
had been freed from the tyranny
of the Spartans by the battle of
Leuctra, so Rome was relieved
of the domination of its tyrant
Clodius by the street-fight in which
he fell. Cf. Att. 5. 13. 1 Ephe—
sum venimus a. d. X l Kal. Sext.
sexagesimo et quingentesimo post
pugnam Bovillanam (Clodius was
killed at Bovillae). Clodius was
murdered Jan. 18, 52 B.C.‚ so that
the date of this letter would be
Feb. 20, 50 Bc (cf. Schmidt,

Briesw. p. 76).
