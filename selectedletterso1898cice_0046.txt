xl INTRODUCTION.

D. Brutus must make a determined stand in Gallia Cisalpina,
and that the governors of the neighboring provinces must
be induced to rally to his support. He wrote therefore
urgent letters to D. Brutus, to Plancus in northern Gaul, to
Lepidus in southern Gaul, and to Pollio in Spain.l Brutus
and Cassius in the East were apprised of the course of events

which his army was completely defeated. But the victory

was elected consul, although but nineteen years of agefi'
