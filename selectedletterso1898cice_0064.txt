lviii INTRODUCTION.

The extant collections contain about 870 letters, of which
423 are included in the Bks. aa' Fam„ 394 in the Bks. ad
Att„ and the remainder is divided almost equally between
the other two collections. The correspondence contains 98
letters from 31 other persons than Cicero. Seventy-three of
these letters are found in the Bks. ad Fam.

66. The collection of letters ad Fam. seems to be made up
of three parts¹1 (i) Bk. 13, (ii) Bks. 1—9 and 14-16‚ (iii) Bks.
10—12. The letters of Bk. 13 are all letters of recommenda-
tion, and were probably collected and perhaps published in
the summer of 44 B.C. Of the other books, 1-9 and
14—16 contain epistles, other than letters of recommendation,
written before the summer of 44 ss.C.; and Bks. 10—12 con-
tain letters written later than that date. The date of
publication of parts ii and iii is not known. In view of the
criticisms made upon Antony in some of these letters, per-
haps they were not published until after the battle of Actium,
or still later.2 The title Epistulae ad Familiares is modern.

Tiro, Cicero's secretary, was making a collection of Cicero's
letters in 44 B.C.3 The collection of letters ad Fam. contains
no letters from Tiro, but many addressed to him, even by
other people than Cicero. He is therefore almost certainly
the editor of this collection.

67. The collection ad Atticum contains no letter from
Atticus. This state of things, together with the well-known
fact that Atticus was a publisher‚ and that Cornelius Nepos
says4 that such a collection of Cicero's letters, not yet
published, was in the possession of Atticus, makes it almost
certain that these letters were arranged for publication by
him. It is probable that they were not published until
