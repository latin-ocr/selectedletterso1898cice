LXXXVI. Rome, Mar. 17, 44
B.c. The 17th and 18th of March
were taken up with meetings of the
senate (cf. Plzz'l. 2. 89). Mar. 19 was
a holiday (Quinquatrus), on which
a burial could not take place, so
that the burning of Caesar’s body
and Antony’s address in the Fo-
rum cannot have taken place be-
fore Mar. 20. On the other hand,
seven days seem to have been the
extreme interval allowed between
death and burial amongst the Ro-
mans (cf. Herodian, 4. 2. 4, with
note by Marquardt, ffizndbuclz,
VII. 348). The burial must have
taken place, therefore, on or before
Mar. 22, τῖε. Mar. 20—22 (Ruete,
16). As for the date of this letter,
there is no mention in it of Cae-
sar’s burial, so that it was prob-
ably written before Mar. 20—22.
In fact, the remarks in 6 make it
highly probable that it was written
on the morning of Mar. 17. Deci-
mus Junius Brutus Albinus had
served under Caesar with distinc-
tion in the campaigns against the
Veneti in 56 ΒΕ. (cf. B. G. 3. 11.
5), and against Vercingetorix in
52 (cf. B. G. 7. 9. Ι). He followed
Caesar in the Civil War (cf. Caes.
B. C. 1. 56—58 apem-sim), and later
served twice as governor of
Gallia Vlterior. In spite of these
favors from Caesar, he was one
of the three most active and
prominent leaders of the conspira-

cy (cf. Suet. Iul. 80; Vell. Patere.
2. 56), and induced Caesar to go
to the curia on the Ides of March.
Caesar had designated him as one
of his second heirs and as gov-
ernor of Gallia Cisalpina (cf. Intr.
40). M. Junius Brutus, who is
addressed (cf. Bruto suo), had
espoused the cause of Pompey in
the Civil VVar (cf. Att. 11. 4. 2),
but was subsequently pardoned by
Caesar and made governor of
Gallia Cisalpina (cf. Ep. LXV.
10 n.). At the time of Caesar’s
assassination he was praetor. C.
Cassius Longinus (cf. Cassio), as
proquaestor of Syria, while Cicero
was governor of Cilicia, carried on
a brilliant campaign against the
Parthians (cf. quo . . . recessisse,
Ep. XXXIV. 7 n.). He supported
Pompey in 49 B.c., but was subse-
quently pardoned by Caesar and
made one of his legates (cf. Ep.
LXV. 10 n.). At the time of Cae-
sar's death he was praetor.

1. Hirtius: consul with Pansa
in 43 Bc. Cf. Ep. LXI. 7. —
infidelissima: this unusual su-
perlative Cicero himself uses
in Ep. LX. 2. — provinciam:
i.e. Gallia Cisalpina.— aiebat:
sc. Antonius. — mediocre auxili-
um dignitatis : with especial
reference to se . . . provinciam
dare posse, above. Caesar’s
assignment of Gallia Cisalpina to
D. Brutus was, however, ratified
