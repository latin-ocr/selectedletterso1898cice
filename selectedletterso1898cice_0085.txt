CICERo’s LETTERS. ’ 3

De iis qui nunc petunt, Caesar certus puta- 2

tur; Thermus cum Silano contendere existimatur, qui
sic inopes et ab amicis et existimatione sunt ut mihi
videatur non esse ἀδύνατον Curium obducere, sed hoc

, praeter me nemini videtur.

Nostris rationibus maxime

conducere videtur Thermum fieri cum Caesare; nemo
est enirn ex iis qui nunc petunt qui, si in nostrum
annum reciderit, firmior candidatus fore videatur, prop-
terea quod curator est viae Flaminiae, quae tum erit ab-
soluta sane facile; eum libenter nunc Caesari consulem ¹

cians; C. Antonius, Q. Cornificius,
L. Cassius Longinus, and C. Lici-
nius Sacerdos, plebeians (cf. As-
con. argum. to Or. in toga caud).
2. qui nunc petunt, wlzo are
candidates tlzis year. — Caesar:
L. Julius Caesar, uncle of An-
tony the triumvir, and, by the
second· marriage of his sister
Julia, brother-in-law of Lentulus,
the Catilinarian conspirator. He
tried unsuccessfully to mediate in
43 B.c. between the senate and
Antony (Phil. 8. 1). He was
placed by Antony upon the list of
the proscribed in return for the
consent of Octavius to the murder
of Cicero, and escaped death only
through the devotion of his sister
Julia. — certus: here ‘ sure to win.'
This expectation was realized.——-
Thermus cum Silano: the con-
suls for 64 B.C. (cf. Ep. ΙΙ.) were
L. Julius Caesar and C. Marcius
Figulus, so that either another

(Cat. 4. 7).—-Thermus . . . ex-
istimatur: tle. it is expected that
there will be a hard fight between
Thermus and Silanus—ab ami-
cis ε ab is not infrequently used to
introduce a limitation with adjec-
tives which signify power, equip-
ment, or their opposites, eg. αὖ·

8. 6, and elsewhere. -— Curium ob-
ducere: zle. to run Curius in oppo-
sition. Curius, evidently a man
held in light esteem, may have

-been the Quintus Curius who in-

formed Cicero of Catiline’s plans.
— Thermum fieri: sc. consulem.
— si in nostrum annum recide-
rit, if lte goes over to my year,
tle. to the election for 63 Rc.
—viae Flaminiae: the great
northern thoroughfare'from Rome
to the Adriatic. The completion
(absoluta) Of, this road would, as
Cicero thinks, give Thermus po-
litica] prestige and influence, and
therefore make him a dangerous
opponent a year later, although at
the time of writing he has few
followers (inopes ab amicis).
“ The great Roman roads, such as
the via A ppia, Hamim‘a, etc„ were
called viae praetoriae or consula-
