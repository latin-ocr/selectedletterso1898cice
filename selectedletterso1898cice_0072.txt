lxvi INTRODUCTION.

B. SYNTAX.

T lie Substantive.

83. (a) The accusative is used a little more freely in
the Letters than in formal literature. It occurs after
verbs of thought and the expression of thought, and
after verbs signifying to strive, to langlz, to hope, etc.;
e.g. lcoc a te praesens contendissem (Cael, Fam. 8. 16. 4);
Catulum mila· narras (Fam. 9. 15. 3); iurare Iovem Lapidem
(Fam. 7. 12. 2); qnam primam llaec risum veni (Cael.‚ Fam.
8. 14. 4). Two accusatives occur in a few instances after
verbs signifying te seek, to warn, etc.; e.g. illud antem te
peto (Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2); qnod et respublica me et nostra
amicitia hortatur (Cato, Fam. 15. 5. 1); and an adverbial
accusative made up of partem and the adjective magnam or
maiorem or minimam is found several times3 eg. curare
soles libenter, nt ege maiorem partem nillil curare (Cael., Fam.
8. 9. 3). Cf. note to illncl tepete, Epist. LII. 2.

(b) With the exception of a few Grecisms‚ eg. cogitatio
dignissima tuae virtutis (Balbus, An. 8. 1521. 1), the only
thing noteworthy with respect to the genitive consists in the
rather free use of the genitive of quality and the partitive
genitive. Cf. aliquo terrarum, Epist. LXXXVI. 3 n.

(c) The dative of reference and the ethical dative are
great favorites in the Letters‚ the latter especially with at,
ecce, and liic. Perhaps in their use of the ethical dative
Cicero and his correspondents have been surpassed only by
the writers of comedy. Cf. ecce tibi et Bruti et tuae litterae
(Aa. 14. 19. 1) ; at ille tibi . . . pergit Brundisium (Aa. 8.
8. 2). Cf. also notes to minori curae, Epist. XXV. 2, and to
ecce, Epist. XXXV. 23.

(d) Certain public events, recurring at regular or irreg-
ular intervals, were of such importance in the eyes of the
people that they were used in marking the date of an event.
