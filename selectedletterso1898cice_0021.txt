CICERO’S PUBLIC LIFE AND CONTEMPORARY POLITICS.

I. CICERo’s EARLY LIFE AND THE CURSUS HONORUM.

(Aet. 1-44. ac. ποῶ-63. Epist. I.-II.)

1. Μ. Tullius Cicero was born at Arpinum, Jan. 3, 106 3.(3.1
His father's family removed to Rome while Cicero was still
a boy‚² and here, like other boys of the period, Cicero pur-
sued the study of Greek and Latin literature, rhetoric, and,
somewhat later, philosophy and jurisprudence. His studies
were interrupted in 89 B.C. by a year's service in the Social
War,3 but at its close they were taken up again with his old
vigor. His chosen profession was that of the law, and in
81 ΒΕ. he made his first appearance at the bar in defending
P. Quinctius. A far more important event was his defense
of Sex. Roscius of Ameria in the following year. Some
political significance attaches to the trial, as Cicero's real
antagonist, Chrysogonus‚⁴² was a favorite of the dictator
Sulla.

2. Possibly to escape the consequent displeasure of
Sulla, but more probably for the sake of his health, Cicero
left Rome and spent nearly two years at Athens, Rhodes,
and in Asia Minor‚⁵ being mainly engaged in the study of
