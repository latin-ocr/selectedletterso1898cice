264 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. XCI.

XXVIII. 2 and this letter, 8).
Later in life Matius wrote a book
upon gastronomy (Columella, 12.
4. 2). He belonged to that group
of nien who attached themselves
closely to the fortunes of Cae-
sar, but not, like many of his
comrades, with the hope of per-
sonal gain. He followed Caesar
out of pure friendship and admira-
tion. When Caesar was killed,
therefore, he found no common
point of sympathy either with
those who rejoiced in the death of
a tyrant, as did Cicero, or with
those who used Caesar’s name to
conjure with, as did Antony. His
grief at Caesar's death and his
superintendence of the public
games in his name called forth
unfriendly criticism from Cicero.
The sorrow of Matius upon hear-
ing this fact was disclosed to
Cicero by their common friend
Trebatius (cf. Ep. XXI. introd.
note), who had made the ac-

quaintance of Matius nine years
before in Gaul (cf. Ep. XXVIII.
2), and led to the writing of this
letter.

1. nihil sibi longius fuisse:
i.e. ‘nothing was more desired by
him.⁹ This is the meaning of the
phrase when followed by quam ut
or quam dum, but when followed
by quam with the infin. it means
‘nothing is more tiresome.' Cf.
A ntibarbarus s. v. longus. — que-
relam tuam: cf. introd. note.

2. vetustas: Cicero had appar-
ently known Matius for twenty
years or more3 cf. next note.—
tuus deinde discessus: on deinde
cf. Intr. 85 b. The reference is to
the absence of Matius from Rome
at some time prior to Cicero's can-
didacy for the consulship3 cf. am-
bitio nostra—vitae dissimili-
tudo: Matius apparently never
entered public life. -— congluti-
nari: the metaphorical use of the
word is frequent in Cicero.
