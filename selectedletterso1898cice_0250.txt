tlze Domitii are everywhere going
wrong. One Domitius surrendered
Corfinium, and another has now
let himself be killed, so that Cae-
lius is obliged to make a long
march to the Alps in the middle
of winter. On se dare, see advo-
les, Ep. XXV. 4 n.-—Venere
prognatus : τῖε. Caesar, who
claimed to be descended from
Venus. — Psacade natus: τῖε.
Bellienus. Psacas (Ψακάς) means
a ‘crumb‚’ ‘morsel‚' or anything
insignificant. Psacade natus
would therefore mean ‘ the son of
a nobody,' and is coined by Cae-
lius to offset Venere prognatus.
He wishes that Caesar had shown
as much sternness in putting Do-
mitius Ahenobarbus to death after
the capture of Corfinium as Belli-
enus had shown in the case of the

, other Domitius. — f. s. d.: forfilio

salutem dices ; cf. nos dilzjqes, Ep.
XVIII. (end) n. and Intr. 62. The
admiration which Caelius felt for
Caesar, and his enthusiasm for
the latter's brilliant campaign, give
to the letter an extravagant and
unconventional tone, which nat-

urally finds expression in the use
of colloquial and archaic words
and phrases. Cf.v the notes on
nugax, commorit, ambulando con-
fecerunt, malis orbiculatis, etc.,
quam sollicitus sum, nisi si, peream
si, isto, illi, discupio, quam multa,
lzui, and se . . . dant. The style
of the letter confirms the judg-
ment of Tacitus in regard to‘Cae-
lius (Dial. 21) : Sordes autem illae
verborum et scians compositio et
inconditi sensus redolent antiqui-
tatem, nec quemquam adeo anti-
quarium puto ut Caelium ex ea
parte laudet qua antiquus est.
XLIX. Formiae, March 19 (or
20), 49 B.C. Cicero's reply to Ep.
XLVII. A copy of it was for-
warded to Atticus with Att. 9. 11
(cf. Att. 9. 11. end).‚ Cicero still
cherishes the hope that he may be
able to effect a reconciliation be-
tween Caesar and⁴ Pompey, and
with that object in view, and per-
haps also to present himself in a
favorable light before Caesar, he
emphasizes the neutrality of his
course thus far, and condemns the
radical steps taken by the Pom-
peians. Caesar's definite request
