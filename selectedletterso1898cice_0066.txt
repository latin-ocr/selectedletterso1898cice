lx INTRODUCTION.

ninth or tenth century and contains all of the Epist. ad Fam.
This manuscript, in the opinion of most editors, is of para-
mount authority for the text. Bks. 1-8 of this collection
are also *found in two manuscripts of the twelfth century,
one in the library of the British Museum and the other
in the National Library at Paris. Another manuscript of
the eleventh century in the British Museum and one of the
fifteenth or sixteenth century at Rome contain Bks‚ 9-16.
In 1345 Petrarch discovered at Verona a manuscript
containing the Epist. ad Att., ad Q. fr„ and ad M. Brut„

only other independent sources for the text of these letters
are a few leaves at Wurzburg and Munich, and a manuscript
known to us only through the marginal readings in one of the
early editions, that of Cratander, published in Basel in 1528.

and style of Cicero's correspondence an examination of the
Latinity of the thirty-one writers from whom letters are
preserved would be necessary. Some of these writers, eg.
Caelius (Bk. 8, ad Fam), have left us sufficient material
upon which to base a fair estimate of their individual char-
acteristics; but such a discussion would be too extended
for our purposes. An examination, however, of the letters
reveals certain elements common ⁴to the correspondence
as a whole which differentiate epistolary Latin from the
language used in more formal writing. Epistolary Latin is
one of the forms of the sermo cotidianus, the speech used in
