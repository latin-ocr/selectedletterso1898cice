CAELIVS CICERONI S.

Ecquando tu hominem ineptiorem quam tuum Cn.
Pompeium vidisti, qui tantas turbaS, qui tam nugax
esset, commorit? Ecquem autem Caesare nostro acri—
orem in rebus gerendiS, eodem in victoria temperatio-
rem aut legisti aut audisti? Quid est? Nunc tibi
nostri militeS, qui durissimis et frigidissimis lociS, tae-
terrima hieme bellum ambulando confecerunt, malis
orbiculatis esse pasti videntur? ‘ Quid iam?' inquis,
Gloriose omnia. ζ’ Si scias quam sollicitus sum, tum

XLVIII. Place of writing un-
known3 about March 9, 49 Rc.

I. tuum: opposed to nostro
below. — nugax : adjectives in ax
are found relatively much more
frequently in colloquial Latin ; cf„
eg„ Plaut. Pers. 410, 421; Capt.
9593 Petron. 433 132. Cicero in
his own letters uses only one such
adjective, tagax (Att. 6. 3. Ι). In
the letters to Cicero we find minax
(Fam. 11. 3. 1); pugnax (Fam. 8.
13. 1 and 10. 31. 5); efficax (Fam.
8. Io. 3); sagax (Fam. Io. 23. 4),
and nugax here—commorit: for
· syncopation in the Letters‚ cf. Intr.
82. The loss of v in the perfect
tenses of moveo and its compounds
is peculiar, since the lost letter Is
not the sign of the perfect system
but belongs to the stem. Cf.
Priscian, 10. 3. 16 (Keil, ΙΙ. 508),
upon this point. — temperatio-
rem: cf. hunc, Ep. XLVI. 2 n.—
quid est? nunc tibi, etc„ well!
a'o our soldiers, wlco ln tlte rouglzest

and coldest sort (ff a country,
in tlte most abominable winter
weather, lzave promenaded through
tlze war, seem to you to have dined
on trzffles .? Caesar crossed the
Rubicon Jan. Io, 49 B.C.‚ of the old
calendar, but as the time of year
was really late autumn, the season
was not in itself unfavorable to
military operations; but his troops
had been obliged to make a diffi-
cult passage over the ApennInes.
In this campaign of two months
Caesar had invested northern
Italy, and made 3o‚ooo men pris-
oners of war without a serious
engagement. Upon quid est, cf.
Intr. 98.— ambulando confece-
runt and malis orbiculatis esse
pasti look like proverbial expres-
sions. The malum orbiculatum,
a fine fruit so named from its
shape‚ was regarded as a great
delicacy.—gloriose omnia: sc.
sacta sunt. —quam sollicitus
sum: this MSS. reading need
