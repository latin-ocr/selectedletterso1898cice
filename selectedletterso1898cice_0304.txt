LXXV. Athens, March‚n45 B.C.
Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who was
of about the same age as Cicero,
was for a time his rival in oratory,
but, soon recognizing his friend's
matchless oratorical powers, he
turned his attention to the study
of jurisprudence, and was for
many generations a leading au-
thority in that subject. His opin-
ions are frequently quoted in the
Digest. In politics he was, like
Cicero, a conservative and a lover
of peace, and, as such, strove dur-
ing his consulship in 51 to avert
the impending struggle between
Caesar and Pompey. XVhen the
other Pompeians left Rome at the
outbreak of the Civil XVar, Sulpi-
cius was prevented by illness from

accompanying them, and, like Cic-
ero, he hesitated long whether to
maintain a neutral position or to
join them. A lively correspon—
dence upon this point passed be-
tween the two in 49 (cf. Fam. 4. 1,
2). In 46 he was made governor
of Achaia by Caesar (cf. Ep. LXV.
10). After the death of Caesar,
in the struggle between Antony
and D. Brutus, his sympathies
were again upon the side of peace
and compromise, and he was sent
by the senate, in 43 B.C.‚ upon a
peace embassy to Antony, who
was laying siege to Mutina. While
on his way thither he died. Cic-
ero’s ninth Philippic is a eulogy on
him. This epistle, like the letters
from Caesar, Lucceius, and Dola-
bella (Intr. 53), was called forth
by the death of Tullia, and is per-
haps the most widely known of
all the letters in the correspond-
ence of Cicero.
