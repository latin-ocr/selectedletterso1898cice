242 CICERO’S LETTERS.

[Ep. LXXXII.

LXXXII. (Fam. 7. 25.)

CICERO S. D. M. FADIO GALLO.

Quod epistulam conscissam doleS‚ noli laborare, salva

est; domo peteS‚ curn libebit.

Quod autem me moneS,

valde gratum est, idque ut semper facias rogo; videris
enim mihi vereri ne, si istum ludibrio habuerimUS,

rideamus ’γέλωτα σαρδάνιον.

Sed heus tu, manum de

’ tabula! magister adest citius quam putaramus3 vereor

Caesar and Cicero's fear of Cae-
sar’s anger prevented Cicero from
maintaining long the manly posi-
tion which he assumes in this and
the following letter, for about a
month later he writes to Atticus:
miror te nihildum cum Dgellio ,·
velut hoc z'jbszc'm quantum accepe—
rit, prorsus aveo scire nec tamen
flocci facio (Att. 13. 50. 3); and
about the same time: ngrellium
totum milei (sc. reduc in gratiam)
et quidem quam primum ; nam
pendeo animi (Att. 13. 51. 2). Cf.
Schmidt, Bricsw. pp. 353 ff.

LXXXII. Tusculum, about
Aug. 24, 45 B.c.

1. quod . . . salva est: appar-
ently Gallus had destroyed p.
LXXXI. after reading it, for ear
that it might fall into the hands
of Tigellius or of his friends.
Cicero seems to assure Gallus,
however, that he has preserved a
copy.—-quod, etc.: cf. Intr. 91
and Fam. 7. 32, 33.—m0nes:
sc. ut cautior sim. — istum : i.e. Ti-
gellius. —- γέλωτα, σαρδάνιον; a
bitter laugh of anger or secret
triumph. But perhaps we should
read, with Ernesti, σαρδόνιον. Σαρ-
δόνιον was a poisonous plant of
Sardinia, which caused death when
eaten, and which so distorted the
faces of those who ate it that

they seemed to be laughing. The
jest would then be in harmony
with the sneers at the Sardinian
origin of Tigellius in the previous
letter. —heus tu: cf. Ep. XXXV.
25 .n.— manum de tabula: sc.
tolle. The schoolmaster (Caesar)
has been away (in Spain), but sud-
denly returns, and those under
him (like Cicero and Gallus) had
better stop the pranks they have
been playing in his absence, or
they will suffer for it (cf. in Ca-
tonium Catoninos). Cicero is
probably thinking of a roomful
of schoolboys‚ who, instead of
giving their attention to vthe task
set thern, have amused themselves
during the master's absence by
scribbling upon their tabulae. The
master suddenly, appears, and the
order comes manum de tabula
(tollite). The scribbling which
Cicero and Gallus have been
guilty of during Caesar’s absence,
is in writing political biographies
of Cato. Cf. Catonem tuum, Ep.
LXXXI. 2 n. Or the reference
may be general: ‘No more indis-
cretions.’ Cf. Otto, Spriclzwc'irter‚
210. — citius quarn putaramus:
Caesar arrived from Spain Sept,
45 B.C.; (cf. Suet. lul. 83). He had
been expected in the last week of
Aug. (cf. Att. 13. 51. 2). —vereor
