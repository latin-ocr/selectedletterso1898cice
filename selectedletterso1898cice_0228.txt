TVLLIVS TIRONI svo s. P. D. ET CICERO ET Q.
FRATER ET Q. F.

Varie sum adfectus tuis litteris, valde priore pagina
perturbatuS‚ paulum altera recreatus Quare nunc
quidem non dubito quin, quoad plane valeaS, te neque
navigationi neque viae committas, Satis te mature
videm, si plane confirmatum videro, De medico et
tu bene existimari scribis et ego sic audio; sed plane.
curationes eius non probo; ius enim dandum tibi non
fuit, cum κακοστόμαχος esses; sed tamen et ad illum
scripsi accurate et ad Lysonem. Ad Curium vero,
suavissimum hominem et summi offici summaeque
humanitatiS, multa scripsi, in iis etiam, ut, si tibi vide-

7 n.--re publica meliore: the
violent discussions in the senate
concerning a successor to Caesar

persona] with an omitted eum for
its subject. Cf. de Quinto fratre,
scito eum non mediocriter laborare,

 

were at their height.

XXXIX. Leucas, Nov. 7, 50 B.C.
Cicero apparently left Tarsus July
30 (cf. Fam. 2. 17. Ι), and, after a
delay of several weeks in Rhodes
and Ephesus, reached the Piraeus
Oct. 14. Toward the end of the
month he set out by land for
Rome. Tiro, who was with him.
was taken ill on the way, and was
left behind at Patrae, while Cicero
continued his journey through
Alyzia and Leucas.

1. existimari: probably imper-
sonal‚ although after de intro-
ducing a transition we find'such
loose constructions that it would
be possible to consider existimari

etc„ Att. 10. 15. 4. ——- ius, soup. —-
κακοστόμαχοςε as the physicians
were usually Greeks, technical med-
ical expressions were in Greek. Cf.
the prescription which Cicero urges
upon Tiro (Fam. 16. 18. I): ea
(εἰσ. valetudo) quid postulet, non
tgnoras ; πέψιν, ἀκοπίαν, περίπατον
σύμμετρον, τρῖψιν, εὐλυσίαν κοιλίας.
—— Lysonem: Tiro was staying at
Lyso’s house.

2. Curium: M.’ Curius, a Ro-

man knight carrying on a banking -

business in Patrae. The one letter
which we have from him, Fam. 7.
29, full as it is of commercial
terms, would of itself betray his
calling. Fam. 7. 28, 30, and 31
