96. Extravagance in Expression. F ormal literary compo*-
sitions which are intended for publication, and which must
therefore submit to the criticism of the general public, are
more reserved in their expression than is the familiar inter-
course between friends‚ whether carried on by conversation or
correspondence. Abundant illustration of this fact is offered
in the letters which passed between Cicero and his intimate
friends, both in the use of single words and complete state-
ments, e.g. immortalis—:magnas (Plancus, Fam. 10. 11. 1 ):
immortalis ago tibi gratias ‚· infinitzs———maltzs (Pollio, Fam.
10. 32. 4 ): infinitis pollicitationibus. Cf. also nam, cam maxi-
mam cepissem laetitiam ex humanissimi et carissimi patris
epistula, tam vero iucundissimae tuae litterae cumulum milei
gaudii attulerunt (Cicero filius, Fam. 16. 21. Ι). Cf. note
to demiror, Epist. XXVI. 4.

97. Greek Worcls and Plzrases. As Tyrrell remarks,l
Greek words and phrases generally appear in the Corre-
spondence as technical terms in philosophy, rhetoric, politics‚
medicine, and as slang phrases. Doubtless, also, as Cicero
himself intimates, Greek was occasionally used as a possible
protection if a letter should fall into the hands of an enemy.
The Greek technical terms played the same part with ref-
erence to Latin that many of the corresponding technical
terms borrowed from Latin play in modern composition,
while the Greek popular expressions in the Letters may be
compared with current French phrases, Cf. also note to
παρρησίαν, Epist. V. 8.

98. Exelamatory Questions. These questions belong to
the language of everyday life, and almost every one of the
familiar letters offers illustrations of the use of such exclam-
atory phrases as quid iam? car lcoc? etc. Cf. also ξ 92
and note to quid quaeris, Epist. V. 4.
