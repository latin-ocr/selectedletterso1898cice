Pomponia were divorced about
seven years later.

5. Pomptinum: C. Pomptinus,
who was praetor in 63 B.C., was
Cicero's able assistant in the sup-
pression of the Catilinarian con-
spiracy; cf. in Cat. 3. 5. He was
a man of military experience, and
Cicero, appreciating his own igno-
rance in military affairs, and the
danger which threatened his prov-
ince from the Parthians, had made
him one of his four legati. —sic
habeas: cf. sic habeto, Ep. XXVI.
1 n.—cui . . . velim: ‘I wish that
you would tell him that I have
written to·you about him.’ The
reference is to the complimentary
remarks just made.

XXXI. Rome, about May 24,
51 B.c. M. Caelius Rufus was born
about 85 13.C.‚ and carne to Rome
when fifteen or sixteen years of
age to study law and politics.
He sympathized with Catiline, but
took no active part in the con-
spiracy. In 52 B.C. as tribune he
vigorously supported the aristo-
cratic cause, but in later life he

went over to Caesar. In 51 B.C.‚
when his letters to Cicero begin,
Caelius was a candidate for the
curule aedileship. In January, 49,
he opposed the senate, and fled
with Curio to Caesar’ s camp. Dis-
appointed with the‘ spoils’ which
fell to his share, he joined Milo in
an uprising in southern Italy, and
was put to death by Caesar’s
troops in 48. In the social world his
intimacy with Clodia (Ep. VIII. 5)
gave him great notoriety. The
wit and beauty of Caelius attracted
this ‘ Palatine Medea,' and the ban-
quets and revels at Rome and
Baiae, in which Caelius and Clodia
were the central figures, were the
talk of Rome. At last they quar-
relled, and many of the difficulties
in which Caelius was subsequently
involved could be traced directly
to her, in one of which, a charge
of murder, Cicero delivered in his
defense the Or. pro Caelio.

It was natural that Cicero, when
setting out for a distant province
at so critical a moment, should
choose in preference to all others
