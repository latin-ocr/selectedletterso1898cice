1 INTRODUCTION.

QUINTUS TULLIUS CICERO.

55. Quintus Cicero was a man of considerable ability;
and, although he never reached the consulship, he was
aedile in 65 and praetor in 62 B.C. At first he was inclined
to attach himself to Pompey, and in 57 Rc. served as the
latter’s legatus in Sardinia,l but three years later he joined
Caesar in Gaul and took part in the invasion of Britain.
In the civil war, after some hesitation, he espoused the
cause of Pompey, but after the battle of Pharsalus he sought
and obtained pardon from Caesar. In 43 B.C. he was pro—
scribed with Marcus and put to death. Four of his letters
are extant,2 as well as a long documentaddressed to Marcus
when the latter was a candidate for the consulship.

PUBLIUS CORNELIUS DOLABELLA.

56. Cicero was somewhat disturbed3 upon hearing, while
in Cilicia, that his daughter Tullia was betrothed to Dola-
bella, for the young man's career was notorious, and Cicero
himself had twice defended him against serious charges.
These fears were well grounded, for Dolabella neglected
Tullia, and in 46 B.C. they were divorced. Probably in the
hope that Caesar's programme included cancellation of
debts,4 Dolabella joined his party in the civil war and
was designated as Caesar's successor in the consulship for
44 B.C.‚ during the projected Parthian war. In this office
he at first showed some sympathy for the party of Brutus
and Cassius, but later the promise of the province of Syria
induced him to side with Antony. He met his death⁵

while attempting to take this province from one of the con-
spirators (ἓ 43).
