fecti erant, postea quam senatus consulibUS‚ pr„ tr. pl.,
et nobis qui pro cos, sumUS, negotium dederat, ut cura-
remus ne quid res p. detrimenti caperet. Numquam
maiore in periculo civitas fuit, numquam improbi cives
habuerunt paratiorem ducem. Omnino ex hac quoque
parte diligentissime comparatur. Id fit auctoritate et
studio Pompei nostri qui Caesarem sero coepit timere.
Nobis inter has turbas senatus tamen frequens flagita-

upon Rome. — ad Caesarem:
Caesar was at Ravenna—sena-

far as to summon them ὑπεξελθεῖν,
πρὶν τὰς ψήφους διενεχθῆναι. The

principle that the tribune could
not be held responsible for his
official acts seems to have been
' first called into question in the
year 98, in the case of C. Furius,
who had been tribune in the pre-
ceding year, and similar prosecu-
tions occurred in the years 94, 86,
74, 66, and 65 B.C. (cf. Herzog, I.
1167 ff.; Madvig, Ve7f. u. Verw.
Ι. 467). The case before us would
seem to have been the first in·
stance when an attempt was made
to hold a tribune accountable dur-
ing his term of office. As Cae-
sar puts it, de sua salute septimo
die (of the calendar year) cagitare
cogantur, B. C. Ι. 5. Cf. also
Appian, Bell. Civ. 2. 33. Cicero's
words, therefore, nulla vi expulsi,
while technically true, misrepre-
sent the real state of the case. It
was this infringement of the rights
of the tribune which Caesar urged
in justification of his advance

tus, etc.: cf. Caes. B. C. 1. 5.

3. ex hac . . . parte τ zle. on the
side of the Optimates.—qui . . .
timere: this thought recurs fre-
quently in the letters of the next six
months 3 cf„ eg„ Att. S. 8. 1 (Pompe-
ius) eundem (ie. Caesarem) repente
timere coeperat, condicionem pacis
nullam probarat, m'laz'l ad bellum
pamma—senatus . . . trium-
phum: the right of introducing
a subject rested with the presiding
officer. — maius suum benefi-
cium : a greater favor on his part,
since he could arrange a triumph
more worthy of Cicero after the
disposal of Caesar's case—nos
Capuam sumpsimus ε Cicero's
principal duty was to protect Cam-
pania and raise levies there. Cf.
Att. 7. 14. 2 me Pompeius Capuam
venire voluit et adiuvare dilectum,
in quo parum prolixe respondent
Campani coloni· see also Intr.
