240 CICERo’s LETTERS. [Ep. LXXXI.

LXXXI. (Fam. 7. 24.)

M. CICERO S. D. M. FADIO GALLO.

Amoris quidem tui, quoquo me verti, vestigia, vel
proxime de Tigellio; sensi enim ex litteris tuis valde
te laborasse. Amo igitur voluntatem. Sed pauca de
re. Cipius, opinor, olim ‘Non omnibus dormio’ Sic
ego non omnibUS, mi Galle, servio, Etsi quae est haec
servitus? Olim, cum regnare existimabamur, non tarn
ab ullis quam hoc tempore observor a familiarissimis
Caesaris omnibus praeter istum. Id ego in lucris pon0,
non ferre hominem pestilentiorem patria sua3 eumque
addictum iam tum puto esse Calvi Licini Hipponacteo

LXXXI. Tusculum, about
Aug. 20, 45 B.c. For Fadius, see
Ep. IV. introd. note.

1. vestigia: sc. sunt. —vel‚f0r
insutum—Tigellio: the singer
whom Horace dubs Sardus szgel-
lius (Sat. Ι. 3. 3) from his birth-
place, Sardinia, a favorite of Julius
Caesar in Cicero's time, and later
of Octavianus. Cf. Hor. Sat. r. 2
and 3.—Cipius . . . dormio:
Cipius, as the story goes (cf. Fes-
tus), was in the habit of feigning
sleep, but when on a certain
occasion a slave attempted to
steal one of his master’s cups,
Cipius started up, saying, ‘non
omnibus dormio? — opinor: prob-
ably a case of genuine uncertainty
concerning the name, but cf. Hec-
tor Mzevianus, Ep. XVIII. 7 n. ——
olim, once upon a time. —— Sic . . .
servio: he may find it necessary
to be Caesar's slave, but he will
not be the slave of every one of
Caesar's household. Cicero ap-
parently uses the same story in
the same connection in Att. 13.

49. 2 (written about the same time
as this letter), where, however,
the name of Cipius is omitted. —
olim: sc. before Caesar’s assump-
tion of power. —- ab ullis ε sc.
observabam from* observor. —- a
familiarissimis: Gallus had evi-
dently expressed the fear that Ti-
gellius, who was angry at Cicero,
might use his influence with Cae-
sar against him. Cicero therefore
assures Gallus that there has been
no change in Caesar's attitude to
him. Cicero's remark here har-
monizes with statements made a
year before; cf. Ep. LXI. 2.—
pestilentiorem patria sua: cf.
Ep. XVI. (end) n.—-eumque . . .
praeconio, and I tlzz'nle lle llas by
tlzis time been disposed of at the
Hipponactean estimate put upon
lzz'm by Calvus Lz'cz‘m'zts.— Calvi
Licini: Gaius Licinius Macer Cal-
vus was known equally well as an
orator (cf., eg„ Cic. Brut. 280, 283)
and as a poet (cf., eg„ Sen. Contr.
7. 4. 7). The different tendencies
