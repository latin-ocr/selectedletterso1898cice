30 CICERo’s LETTERS. [Ep. v.

tis tuis, quae in Amaltheo posuisti, contenti erimus,
praesertim cum et Thyillus nos reliquerit et Archias
nihil de me scripserit, ac vereor ne, Lucullis quoniam
Graecum poema condidit, nunc ad Caecilianam fabulam
spectet. Antonio tuo nomine gratias egi eamque epi-
stulam Mallio dedi. Ad te ideo antea rarius scripsi,
quod non habebam idoneum cui darem, nec satis scie-

bam quo darem. Valde te venditavi. Cincius si

quid ad me tui negoti detulerit, suscipiam; sed 'nun01

15. Amaltheo: the villa of At-
ticus near Buthrotum, in Epirus,
was so called from the nymph
Amalthea. The libi-ary of this
villa was adorned with the busts
of noted Romans. Cicero's was
among the rest. Beneath the busts
(Nepos, Att. 18. 5) were com-
memorative inscriptions. Cicero
is pleased to receive this recogni-
tion, especially as the contempo-
rary poets at Rome, Thyillus and
Archias, are neglecting him. Ar-
chias is well known because of
Cicero’s oration in his behalf. He
had begun a poem upon Cicero’s
consulship (pro Αν. 28).—Cae-
cilianam fabulam: we know from
Cicero's oration in support of Ar-
chias of the friendship existing
between the latter and the Caecilii
Metelli. The work here mentioned
would seem to have been a dra-
matic composition founded upon
the achievements of the Caecilian
family. One of the earlier writers

of comedy was Caecilius Statius,
whom Cicero calls (Att. 7. 3. 10)
malus auctor Latinitatis, and Cae-
cilianam fabulam may therefore
have a double meaning, ‘a play in
the manner of Caecilius (Statius)
upon the Caecilians.'

16. Antonio: C. Antonius, Cice-
ro’s colleague in the consulship,
and now governor of Macedonia,
a province which he had received
in return for not supporting the
Catilinarians. Cicero had asked
Antonius to grant Atticus some
favor (Fam. 5. 5).-Ma11i0: per-
haps T. Manlius, a negotiator of
Thespiae in whose interest Fam.
13. 22 was written.— quo da-
rem, where to send it.—valde
te venditavi, J leave heartily
praised you, i.e. to Antonius.

18. facere: i.e. an Amaltheum.
