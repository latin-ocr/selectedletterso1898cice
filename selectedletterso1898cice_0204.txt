XXXIV. (Fam. 15. 4.)

M. CICERO IMP. S. D. M. CATONI.

It has also many points of resem-
blance to Caesar’s Commentaries
on the Gallie XVar. The first part
of it is essentially a military report
without embellishment, addressed,
it is true, to Cato, but to all in-
tents and purposes an ‘open let-

Cicero’s campaign is also described
at some length in Att. 5. 20; Fam.
2. 103 and in two letters to the
senate, Fam. 15. Ι and 2.
