ΧΧΧ INTRODUCTION.

which Cassius won over the Parthians near Antioch averted
the threatened invasion of Cilicia, 'and Cicero directed his
forces against the independent people near Mt. Amanus,1
where, after a complete victory, he had the satisfaction of
hearing himself saluted ‘imperator' by his troops.²

25. Toward the end of Dec., 51 B.C., Cicero was in
Tarsus and sent thence official letters to the consuls
asking for a supplicatio,³ accompanied by a letter of similar
purport to Cato, the senatorial leaders* The senate voted
the supplicatiof and, turning over his province to the
quaestor Caelius Caldus, on July 30, Cicero set out on his
homeward journey in high hopes of a triumph. There is no
more honorable period in Cicero's life than that of his pro-

. consulship in Cilicia 3 and with the difficulties which he had

to face, and the poor means at his disposal, his success as
an administrator was highly creditable. The fact that he
did not reorganize his province on a permanent basis, as
Caesar reorganized Gaul, is to be attributed to the shortness
of his tenure of office and the wretchedness of the aristo-
cratic system of government‚ and not to Cicero's own
inability or unwillingness Cicero traveled slowly home—
ward by the way of Rhodes⁶ and Athens, accompanied by
his brother, his son, his nephew, and his freedman Tiro, who
was obliged to remain at Patrae on account of illness.⁷ On
Nov. 24, 50 B.C., he reached Brundisium, where he was met

by his wife Terentia.⁸ After a delay of several weeks at -

his villas near Naples, Cicero at last reached Rome, Jan. 4,
49 B.c.‚⁹ after an absence from the city of a year and eight

months.
