CICERO'S LETTERS. 99

rabiosulas sat fatuas dedisti ; deinde quod τῶν Βρεττα-

νῶν minus φιλοθέωρον te praebuisti, plane non repre-

hendO.

Nunc vero in hibernis iniectus mihi videriS‚

itaque te commovere non curas,

Vsquequaque sapere oportet3 id erit telum acerrimum.

Ego si foris cenitarem, Cn. Octavio familiari tuo non
defuissem; cui tamen dixi, cum me aliquotiens invi-

1. Equo Troiano: cf. Ep. XIX.
2 n. -— sero sapiunt: Cicero
quotes here, as he did in Ep. XIX.
2 (si sciens fallo), the first words
of a familiar passage, which had
passed into a proverb. The ex-
pression is thus explained by F es-
tus, I. 510, de Pon. : ‘ sero sapiunt
Phryges ' proverbium est natum a
Troianis qui decimo denique anno

velle coeperunt Helenam quaeque*

cum ea erant rapta reddere. Cf. also
Ribbeck, Rijm. D‘ag.49. - non se-
ro : Trebatius had gone to Caesar
with such rose-colored ideas of a
soldier's life and of the immediate
wealth and distinction to be won
in it, that the inevitable hardships
and monotony made him discon-
tented and homesick‚ so that Cic-
ero had written him reprovingly:
primorum mensum litteris tuis ve-
hementer commovebar, quod milii
interdum — pace tua dixerim —
levis in urbis urbanitatisque desi-
derio, interdum piger, interdum
timidus in labore militari, saepe
autem etiam, qnod a te alienissi-
mum est, subimpudens videbare ;
tamquam enim syngrapham ad
imperatorem, non epistulam attu—
lisses, etc., Fam. 7. 17. 1. This
letter evidently had the effect in-
tended, for Cicero’s words, non
sero, as well as mi vetule, indi-
cate that Trebatius had repented
of his discontent. — primas illas:
sc. tuas epistulas. — rabiosulas,

a trifle crazy. Cf. pulchellus, Ep.
V. 10 n. The phrase, rabiosulas
sat fatuas, is probably quoted
from some comic poet. Cf„ how-
ever, Ribbeck, Com. Rom. Frag.
p. ΧΙίν.-τῶν Βρεττανῶν minus
ᾠιλοθέωρον, not very fond qf see-
ing tlze signes in Britain. In the
summer of 55 ΒΕ. Caesar made
his first expedition to Britain, in
which Trebatius did not care to
join. —in hibernis iniectus: Cic-
ero is writing toward the end of
November.— te commovere, to
stir ,· as of one crawling out from
under a blanket in cold weather. -—
usquequaque, etc.: probably the
words of Ulysses in the same play
from which the quotation sero
sapiunt was taken. Cf. Ribbeck,
Ram. Trag. p. 49, and Trag. Rom.
Frag. p. 246.—sapere: perhaps
with a double meaning, to be wise
and to be learned in tlze law. Cf.
Ep. XXV. 1 n.—id erit telum
acerrimum: Mezger quotes Fal-
staff's words, ‘Discretion is the
better part of valor.'

2. cenitarem: this frequentative
is not found in Cicero outside of
the Letters.—Cn. Octavio: evi-
dently a pushing fellow, who
wanted the distinction of enter-
taining Cicero. Cf. Fam. 7. 9. 3
Cn. Octavius est an Cn. Cornelius
quidam, tuus familiaris, summo
genere natus, terrae filius. Is me,
quia scit tuum familiarem esse,
