xlii INTRODUCTION.

The first step of the triumvirs was to remove their
enemies at Rome, and Cicero's name was included in the
list of the proscribed, notwithstanding the protest of
Octavius. Cicero at first thought of seeking refuge in the
East, and actually set sail from Astura for that purpose, but
the unfavorable weather and his own unwillingness to leave
his native land held him back, and the emissaries of Antony
found him still in his Formian villa when they reached that
place, Dec. 7. His faithful slaves attempted to save him
even at the last moment by hurrying him on board a ship
which lay in the harbor, but he was overtaken by his pur-
suers, and, forbidding his followers to make resistance, gave
himself up to death at the hands of his assassins.1

THE PRIVATE LIFE OF CICERO.

45. Cicero’s father was in moderate circumstances, and
from him Cicero inherited the family estate at Arpinum and
a house in the Carinae. The dower of his wife Terentia
amounted to 480‚ooo sesterces,2 but the larger part of his
income was derived from legacies left to him by admirers
or by men to whom he had rendered professional service.
In 44 Rc. Cicero boasted3 that he had received more than
2o,ooo,000 sesterces from this source. And one of his
legacies‚ from the philosopher Diodotus,‘² is said to have
amounted to 10‚ooo,ooo sesterces. Possibly Cicero received
also a share of the profits which C. Antonius, his colleague
in the consulship, made in his province.⁵
