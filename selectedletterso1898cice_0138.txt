56 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. XIII.

strum merito eius amo plurimum. Eum, ut potui, per
litteras cohortatus sum gratiasque egi, ut debui. In
novis tr. pl. intellego spem te habere. Id erit firmum,
si Pompei voluntas erit; sed Crassum tamen metuo,
A te quidem omnia fieri fortissime et amantissime
videO, nec miror, sed maereo casum eiusmodi ut tantis
tuis miseriis meae miseriae subleventur. Nam ad me
P. Valerius homo officiosus scripsit, id quod ego maximo
cum fletu legi, quemadmodum a Vestae ad tabulam
Valeriam ducta esses, Hem, mea luX, meum deside-
rium, unde omnes opem petere solebant! Te nunc, mea
Terentia, sic vexari, sic iacere in lacrimis et sordibuS,

vent Cicero's exile, and afterwards
to secure his recall; cf. Fam. 14. 1.

the new tribunes would come into
office Dec. 10, and had all prom-
ised to help Cicero. One of the
number was Milo, leader of the
‘ physical force ' section of the sen—
atorial party. — voluntas erit: sc.
firma.—- Crassum: cf. Ep. VIII.
5 n. — P. Valerius: mentioned
several times in the Letters‚ but
little is known of him.—a (sc.
templo) Vestae: cf. the English
expression ‘from St. Paul’s.' This
ellipsis of templum or aedes be-
tween the preposition and the
genitive of the name of a divinity‚
according to C. F. W. Miillen ap-
pears first in Ter. Ad. 582. ‘It
belongs, therefore, to the collo-
quial language of the Scipionic
circle, and must be considered
rather familiar than vulgar or
archaic.' Cf. ad Opis, Att. 14. 14·
5; acl Apollinis, Ep. XVI. 3; acl
Vestae, Hor. Sat. 1. 9. 35. Some-
what similar is ad L. Tondcz' (do-
mum) vorsu, C. l. L. I. 1143. See
also Intr. 95 and Arclz.s. lat. Lex.

ΙΙ. 368. Terentia's half-sister Fabia
was a Vestal virgin, and Terentia
had probably taken refuge with
her. — ad tabulam Valeriam:
Pliny, Ν. H. 35. 22, quoted by Hof-
mann, tells us that there was a
painting upon the side wall of the
Curia Hostilia, executed by the
order of M.' Valerius Maximus to
celebrate his victories. N ear this
painting (the Tabula Valeria) there
was probably a banker's stall, to
which Terentia was forced to come
to make an affidavit with reference
to her property, or possibly to se-
cure a loan. — hem: a colloquial
word, to be distinguished from the
demonstrative particle em. It ex-
presses joy, astonishment, or, as
here, grief. It is frequent in com-

hoped to win Cicero’s legal or
political support through her in-
