CICERo’s LETTERS.

[Ep. XXI.

ut scribis, ita sunt: multis luminibus ingeni, multae

tamen artis.

Sed cum veneris ἥρ . Virum te putab0, si

Sallusti Empedoclea legeriS‚ hominem non putabO.

XXI. (Fam. 7. 5.)

CICERO CAESARI IMP. S. D.

Vide quam mihi persuaserim te me esse alterum, non
modo in iis rebus quae ad me ipsum, sed etiam in iis

. the business in question was evi-

dently some family matter. —- Lu-
creti poemata: St. Jerome in his
Clzronicle says: T. Lucretius poeta

. cum aliquot libros per iuter-
valla insaniae conscripsisset, quos
postea Cicero emendavit, etc. This
statement that Cicero edited the
poem de Rerum Natura has given
rise to a deal of discussion. It is
certainly true that Cicero and Lu-
cretius exerted an influence upon
each other. Lucretius borrowed
freely from Cicero's Aratea, while
several passages in the philosoph-
ical writings of Cicero closely
resemble verses of Lucretius (cf.
Martha, Le Poeme de Lucrece, 351,
Munro on Lucr. 5. 619, and Merrill
in Class. Rev. for 1896, 19).—
ita: cf. sic, Ep. V. 3 n. — multis
. . . artis: Lucretius probably died
in 55 B.C.‚ so that this criticism
was written within a few months
of his death. It is commonly
supposed that in ingeni Cicero
sums up the main characteristics
of the earlier school of Latin poe-
try, while artis represents the ten-
dencies of the νεώτεροι; ‘ (a poem)
with many indications of brilliant
genius and yet with much of artis-
tic excellence.’ With this esti-
mate of Lucretius, cf. Aul. Gell.

XXI. Rome, April, 54 B.C. C.
Trebatius Testa, the date of whose
birth is uncertain, carne as a boy
to Rome to study law. He be-
came attached to Cicero, and
pleased the latter by both his wit
and good-fellowship, and also as-
sisted him by his knowledge of
jurisprudence. Being anxious,
however, to see something of the
world, to win his spurs, and to
make a fortune, perhaps, in the
provinces, Trebatius set out for
the Roman camp in Gaul, carrying
with him this letter of recommen-
dation. Cicero‘s relations with
Trebatius were of a most intimate
nature, as his seventeen letters to
him (Fam. 7. 6-22) prove. Like
most of the young men who served
upon Caesar's staff in Gaul, Treba-
tius became his devoted admirer,
and followed his fortunes in the
Civil War. He was one of the few
members of that coterie of young
men about Caesar who survived
the Civil WVar and lived to see
Rome at peace under Augus-
