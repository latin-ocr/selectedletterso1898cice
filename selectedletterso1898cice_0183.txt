Fam 7. 10.] CICERO‘S LETTERS. 101

nemo in illa tanta insula peritior te fuisset. Verum
tamen—rideamus licet3 sum enim a te invitatus-—
subinvideo tibi, ultro etiam accersitum ab eo ad quem
ceteri non propter superbiam eius sed propter occupa-
tionem adspirare non possunt. ,Sed tu in ista epistula
nihil mihi scripsisti de tuis rebuS, quae mercule mihi
non minori curae sunt quam meae. Valde metuo ne
frigeas in hibernis. Quamobrem camino luculento
utendum censeo (idern Mucio et Manilio placebat),
praesertim qui sagis non abundares, Quamquam vos
nunc istic satis calere ·audio; quo quidem nuntio valde
mercule de te timueram. Sed tu in re militari multo es

Britanniam: cf. τῶν Βρεττανῶν,
Ep. XXIV. 1 n.—in . . . insula
peritior: where all were savages.
A similar jest at end of Ep. XXIV.
——sum . . . invitatus: the letters of
Trebatius were apparently written
in a personal and humorous vein.
-subinvideo tibi, l envy you a
trffle. Cf. Intr. 77.-- accersitum:
sc. to give advice.

2. minori curae: colloquial
Latin showed a fondness for the
predicate dative after esse ,· and
curae, often with an adjective,
magnae, minori, summae, etc.‚ is
very frequently found in this con-
struction. —— valde metuo, etc„
l am very mztclz afraid tlmt you
are szgffering from cold in your
winter quartem ‚· so l advisa you
to keep a bmjglzt fire going on tlte
heartlz (Mucius and lllcznilins lzold
tlze same opinion), especially as you
are not well supplied with clothing
for a campazgfn, and yet l under-
stand tlcat you find it leot enough,
over tlzere just at present. The
humor of the passage consists in
the rapid transition from the lit-
eral to the metaphorical meaning
of certain words, and in the cita-

tion of learned authorities in sup-
port of sels-evident conclusions.
frigeas in hibernis is perhaps
best taken literally‚ sagis non
abundares with a double mean-
ing, and calere figuratively. —
Mucio: Q. Mucius Scaevola, pon-
tifex maximus, consul in 95 B.C.,
an eminent jurist and Cicero's pre-
ceptor3 cf. Lael. 1. —— Manilio:
M'. Manilius, consul in 149 B.C.; an
authority upon civil law often men-
tioned with Scaevola.— placebat:
like censeo a technical legal word.
—sagis non abundares : inas-
much as Trebatius is not well sup-
plied with heavy garments, and the
weather is cold, his only protection
lies in keeping a good fire; but the
sagum was the typical garment of
a soldier, as the toga was the main
article in the dress of a civilian
(thus sagati, Non. II. 202, Mtill„ is
opposed to togati), and to say that
Trebatius was not well supplied
with saga implied that he avoided
the dangers of the campaign. —-
calere: used metaphorically of the
‘warm work ’ which the insurrec-
tion of the Gauls under Ambiorix
(Caes. B. G. 5. 23—53) gave the
