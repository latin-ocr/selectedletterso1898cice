Caecilius: for the relations exist-
ing between Caecilius and Atticus
and the desire of Atticus to con-
tinue on good terms with his
uncle, cf. Nepos, Att. 5 habebat

Romanum, familiarem L. Luculli.

Cicero's dilemma is therefore a
serious one. If he accedes to the
request of Caecilius, and appears
against Satyrus, he will antagonize
Satyrus and the latter’s friend
Domitius, who are at present very
friendly to him and would be of
great service to him politically. If
he declines to accommodate Cae-
cilius, he will offend the crabbed
old gentleman and Atticus in some
degree, and perhaps jeopardize the
chances of Atticus for his uncle's
property. Caecilius died five years
later (Att. 3. 20. 1).—agere . . .

fratre, cousin,· cf. Att. 1. 5. 1.—
dolo malo: the formulae de dolo
malo, first drawn up by the juris-

consult Aquilius Gallus (ἓ 1), were
used in actions for damages on
the ground of fraud. Cum ex eo
(A quilio) quaereretur quid esset
a'olus malus, respondebat, cum esset
aliud simulatum, aliud actum
(Cic. de Off 3. 60). In this case
Varius would seem to have trans-
ferred his property to Satyrus, to
save it from seizure by the cred-
itors.—-mancipio accepisse, to
lzave purchased. mancipio (ma-
nus -Ι- capio) refers to the practice
on the part of the purchaser of
laying his hand upon the article
purchased in the presence of five
witnesses‚ as the binding act in his
acquisition of the article—dice-
ret: ⁴ by a carelessness of expres-
sion, the verb of saying or think-
ing is sometimes put in the sub-
junctive instead of the thing said '
(Tyrrell). — L. Lucullus: Pom-
pey’s predecessor in command of
the army acting against Mithri-
dates—P. Scipio: best known
as commander of the Pompeian
forces at the battle of Thapsus
in 46 B.c. Cf. Bell. Afr. 79—86.
——magistrum (sc. auctionis): the
bids at auctions were received and
called out by the praeco, but the
general management of such a sale
was in the hands of a magister auc-
tionis, who kept a record of the
articles sold and in general was the
legal representative of the owner.
