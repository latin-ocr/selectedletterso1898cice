The stem of the plant was cut into thin stripS. and these
strips were laid parallel to one another upon a smooth sur-
face; another set of strips was laid upon these at right
angles, and the two layers were glued together by the gum
which exuded from the strips when they were moistened
with water. The layers were then hammered together into
a single sheet‚ called a plagula. which was exposed to the
sun to dry. The sheets were from 5 to 10 inches long. and
probably one sufficed for an ordinary letter. If more space
was needed, several sheets were pasted together. The
center of the papyrus industry was Alexandria.
