CICERO'S LETTERS. 195

potes neque ollam denariorum implere, Romam tibi
remigrandum est; satius est hic cruditate quam istic

fame.

Video te bona perdidisse; spero idem istuc
Actum igitur de te est, nisi provides

Potes mulo isto quem tibi reliquum dicis esse, quoniam

cantherium comedisti, Romam pervehi.

CICERO PAETO.

Dupliciter delectatus sum tuis litteris, et quod ipse 1
risi et quod te intellexi iam posse ridere; me autem a
te, ut scurram velitem, malis oneratum esse, non mo—

tionem acczfiere, Ep. LXI. 7.—
ollam denariorum implere: this
phrase has a proverbial ring to it,
and calls up the picture of the
miser with his pot of gold, as he
is represented in the Aulularia, for
instance. In this case, however,
the pot of Paetus contained not
gold but only silver denarii. The
Greek genitive after complere and
implere, which is frequent in Plau-
tus (cf.‚e.g.,Amplz. 471 3 Aul. 552,
and Brix on Men. 901), is found
several times in Cicero.— satius
est: sc. mori.— spero idern istuc ε
sc. passos esse. In that case, they
could not give Paetus dinners to
keep him from going to Rome. —
aetum igitur de te est, it is all
up wille you. Cf. transactum est,
Ep. XI. 3 n.—in ludo: τῖε. in
Cicero's school of oratory.— prox-
ima : sc. meae sellae.

Aug„ 46 B.C.

1. scurram velitem : the scurra
was the professional wit and diner-

out, whose object in life was to
secure a good dinner, and whose
stock in trade was flattery, wit, and
buffoonery, — the character which
has been immortalized by Terence
in the person of Phormio, and by
Plautus in Peniculus. The veles
was a skirmisher. Therefore a
scurra veles would be a wit who
carried on a guerilla warfare, tak-
ing a shot at every one and every-
thing about him. The compari-
son is made more apt by the fact
that in these very letters (eg. Ep.
LXI. 7) Cicero has been threaten-
ing to dine with Paetus whether
he wishes him or not. The oppor-
tunity of the scurra at a dinner
came with the secunda mensa,
when the company gave itself up
to conversation and jest, but the
mala (apples), which were brought
on at this point, lent themselves
as ready missiles to be used against
the jester. In a similar way, to
the volley of wit which Cicero had
aimed at Paetus in his letters Pae-
