Fam. 3. 2.] CICERo’s LETTERS. 107

Neque enim mea commendatione te non delectari facile
patiebar et nunc angor quicquam tibi sine me esse
iucundum. Sed hoc tamen malo ferre nos desiderium
quam te non ea quae spero consequi. Quod vero in C.
Mati, suavissimi doctissimique hominis, familiaritatem
venisti, non dici potest quam valde gaudeam. Qui fac ut
te quam maxime diligat. Mihi crede, nihil ex ista provin-
cia potes quod iucundius sit deportare. Cura ut valeaS.

quotation from some poet, and
compares for the sentiment Plaut.
T rin. 668: Itast amor, ballista ut
iacitur, nil sic celerest neque vo-
lat: 1 Atque is mores hominum
moros et morosos efficit.

2. C. Mati: cf. Ep. XCI.‚ introd.
note, and XCII. — suavissimi:
Ep. XCII. affords excellent proof
of the correctness of this character-
ization. — doctissimi: Matius not
only wrote a book upon gas·
tronomy‚ but Cicero found the
impulse to some of his best
philosophical work in the lively
sympathy of Matius. (Ξὲ.φιλοσοφού-
μενα, Ep. XCI. 5n.—familiari-
tatem: the friendship formed be-
tween Matius and Trebatius in
Gaul continued unshaken through
all the vicissitudes of the Civil VVar.
Cf. Ep. XCI. 1, Att. 9. 15 A.—
mihi crede: cf. Ep. XXVII. 1 n.

XXIX. After leaving Rome,
about Mar„ 51 B.C. Cicero’s re-
quest‚ embodied in this letter, that
Appius Claudius Pulcher, his

predecessor in the proconsulship
of Cilicia, should turn over the
province to him in as satisfactory
a condition as possible, was far
from being fulfilled; and Cicero
found himself under the necessity
of changing many of the corrupt
and tyrannous practices of the
late governor‚——a course which
brought upon him the enmity of
Appius. Upon his return to Rome,
Appius was charged with misgov-
ernment by Dolabella,Cicero's son-
in-law‚but escaped punishment with
the help of Pompey. For the limits
of Cicero's province, cf. Intr. 23.

The possession of the title pro-
consul (procos.)‚ carrying along
with it the imperium, indicates
that Cicero wrote this letter at
some point outside of Rome. Ap-
pius received the title of imperator
(imp.) from his troops, because of
a successful campaign against the
mountaineers of his province.
