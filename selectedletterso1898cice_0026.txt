xx INTRODUCTION.

10. In December of this year, while Caesar was absent
in Spain, a festival was held at his house in honor of the
goddess Bona Dea, which it was unlawful for men to attend 3
but during the meeting, P. Clodius, a patrician, was found
to be present in disguise (cf. Epist. V.). A judicial
investigation of the matter was made, but Clodius secured
an acquittal through the kind offices of Crassus, who
bribed a majority of the jurors. Cicero does not seem to
have taken an active part in the discussion of the Clodian
matter in the senate,1 but when, in the trial, Clodius
attempted to establish an alibi by offering evidence to
prove that he was at Interamna, ninety miles from Rome,
at the time of the sacrilege, Cicero went on the witness
stand and testified that he had seen Clodius in Rome within
three hours of the time he claimed to have been at Inter-
anina.‘“'

The anger of Clodius was aroused still more by the humil-
iation which he suffered in debate at Cicero's hands,3 so
that henceforth he thought of little else than avenging
himself upon Cicero. The clash between Clodius and the
senate, and the desire which Clodius felt to injure Cicero,
threw Clodius into the arms of the democratic party, so
that the affair, which at the outset was a purely persona]
one, developed into a politica] antagonism.‘¹

11. In Jan.‚ 61 ΗΟ, before the trial of Clodius took place,
Pompey returned from the East. Both the senatorial party
and the democratic party were anxious to secure his support 3
but, with that fatuity which characterized his conduct so
often, he satisfied neither faction. The senate, however,
found an opportunity to punish him for his coldness toward
them by declining either to ratify his arrangements in the
