CICERO'S LETTERS. 71

DE IIS FERRETVR VT QVI NON DISCESSISSENT EA POENA

QVAE EST DE VI TENERENTVR.

A. d. 111 Idus Febr. 6

dixi pro Bestia de ambitu apud praetorem Cn. Domi-
tium in foro medio maximo conventu, incidique in eum
locum in dicend0‚ cum Sestius multis in templo Casto-
ris vulneribus acceptis subsidio Bestiae servatus esset.
Hic προῳκονομησάμην quiddam εὐκαίρως de his, quae
in Sestium apparabantur crimina, et eum ornavi veris

laudibus magno adsensu omnium.

political purposes3 cf. de Pet. Cons.
19 nam lzoc biennio quattuor soda-
litates hominum ad ambitionem
gratiosissimorum tibi oblzgrasti . . .
qua re lzoc tibi faciendum est, lzoc
tempore ut ab iis quod debent engas
saepe commonendo rogando con-
firmando curando ut intellegant
nullum se umquam aliud tempus
habituros referendae gratiae. Clo-
dius saw the advantage to be
derived from such bodies, and re-
organized them in 58 B.C. Under
his control they played a part in
politics not unlike that of the po-
litical clubs in France before the
Revolution. The decuriati were
men organized into decuriae or
gmups, in this case for political
purposes; cf. pro Sest. 34.—que
is explanatory3 ‘political clubs‚
tle. definite organizations.‘-—dis-
cederent, should disband. —lex
. . . ferretur: ie. in the comitia.
Cf. Ep. V. 2 n. Such organiza-
tions were not effectually con-
trolled until under Julius Caesar’s
constitution the permission of the
senate was required before perma-
nent societies with fixed times of
meeting and standing deposits
could be organized.

6. pro Bestia: L. Calpurnius
Piso Bestia, the tribune who in 63
ΒΕ. by a speech against Cicero was
to give the signal to the conspira-

Res homini fuit

tors for active operations (Sall. Cat.
43. Ι). The oration for Bestia has
not been preserved. — Cn. Domi-
tium (Calvz·num): he supported in
later years the cause of Caesar in
the Civil War. The last reference
to him is in connection with an un-
successful campaign against Phar-
naces in 47 Rc. (Bell. Alex. 65).
—cum Sestius, etc.: in Jan.‚ 57
B.C.‚ after many delays a proposi-
tion to recall Cicero from exile
was laid before the people; but as
Clodius had already filled the
comitimn and the curia with armed
men, a riot followed, in which
Sestius was seriously wounded.
The forces of Cicero's friends had
taken up their position at the tem-
ple of Castor, on the south side
of the Forum; cf. pro Sest. 75 f.
—— προῳκονομησ-άμην, brought out
in advance. By eulogis⁰tic refer-
ences to Sestius, Cicero wished to
pave the way for the oration in
his behalf, which was delivered a
month later and brought about
his acquittal (Q. fi. 2. 4. 1).—
homini: here, as elsewhere in the
Letters, almost equivalent to a pro-
noun. This use may be colloquial,
as it is unusually frequent in com-
edy, eg. Ter. Ad. 536 SY. Facio
te apud illum deum? virtutes narro.
CT. Meas? SY. Tuas‚· homini
ilico lacrumae cadunt.
