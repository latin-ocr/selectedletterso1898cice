CICERO'S LETTERS.

191

habeo, cenandi magistros; puto enim te audisse, si
forte ad vos omnia perferuntur, illos apud me declami-

tare, me apud illos cenitare.

Tu autem quod mihi

bonam copiam eiureS, nihil est; tum enim, cum rem
habebas, quaesticulis te faciebat attentiorem, nunc,
cum tarn aequo animo bona perdaS, non est quod non
eo sis consilio ut, cum me hospitio recipiaS, aestima-
tionem te aliquam putes accipere; etiam haec levior

est plaga ab amico quam a debitore.

Nec tamen eas 8

magnificum sit et lautum.

apparently, of the celebrated ‘open
letter’ to Cicero, which was in-
tended to counteract the political
effect of Cato's suicide and of
Cicero’s eulogy upon him (cf. Intr.
33, 42).— Dolabellam: see Intr.
56. Cassius and Pansa were also
pupils of Cicero ; cf. Fam. 7. 33. 2.
Cicero's object in giving his time
to these aspirants for oratorical
honors seems to have been largely
a desire to secure through them
the friendship of Caesar, for he
writes to Atticus two years later:
lzaud amo vel lios designatos (ie.
Hirtius and Pansa) qni etiam de-
clamare me coegerunt, ut ne apud
aquas quidem acquiescere liceret ‚·

dinner.—quaesticu1is: cf. Intr.
76. The subject of faciebat is res
understood. — bona perdas: as a
partial relief to the debtor class,
Caesar appointed arbitrators to
estimate the value which certain
property had before the Civil War
began, and this property creditors
were obliged to take at its esti-
mated value3 cf. Caes. B. C. 3. 1. 2
per eos (ie. arbitros) fierent aesti-
mationes possessionum et rerum,
quanti quaeque earum ante bel-
lum fuisset, atque liae creditoribus
traderentur. Many creditors, of
whom Paetus seems to have been
one, had suffered seriously from
being obliged to accept this depre-
ciated property.— aestimationem
