152 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. XLII.

2 suscipias aeger et‘periculose hieme naviges. Ego ad
urbem accessi pr. Non. Ian. Obviam mihi sic est prod-
itum ut nihil possit fieri ornatius; sed incidi in ipsam
flammam civilis discordiae vel potius belli, cui cum
cuperem mederi et, ut arbitror, possem, cupiditates
certorum hominum <nam ex utraque parte sunt qui
pugnare cupiant) impedimento mihi fuerunt. Omnino
et ipse Caesar, amicus noster, minacis ad senatum et
acerbas litteras miserat et erat adhuc impudenS‚ qui
exercitum et provinciam invito senatu teneret, et Curio
meus illum incitabat3 Antonius quidem noster et Q.
Cassius nulla vi expulsi ad Caesarem cum Curione pro-

2. obviam mihi: cf. Cicero's
account of his reception on return-
ing from exile in Ep. XV. 5.-
mederi: Cicero's absence from
Italy while civil war was brewing,
his absence from the senate dur-
ing the stormy debates of the first
week in January, as well as his
well-known opportunism in poli-
tics, and his friendly relations with
both Caesar and Pompey, seemed
to make him the natural mediator
between the opposing factions.
That he hoped to effect a com-
promise is clear from many re-
marks in the Letters (cf.‚ eg„ Ep.
LXV. 5). What many condemn
as cowardice in his course during
the Civil War finds at least partial
justification in his desire to keep
a neutral attitude‚ which would
enable him to negotiate a peace.
—— ex utraque parte : among
others Cicero is thinking of the
Pompeians Scipio and Lentulus,
and the Caesarians Antony and
Cassius; cf. Caes. B. C. 1. 1-4‚ and
see Ep. LXV. 6 victa est, etc.—
minacis . . . litteras: the letter
read by Curio in the senate Jan. 1
(see introd. note). Caesar (B. C. 1.

5) characterizes the propositions
contained in his letter as lenissima
postulata. Cicero's characterization
of the letter would seem to be jus-
tified, however, by Caesar's own
statement of his purpose in B. C.
Ι. 22 ut se et populum Romanum
factione paucorum oppressum in
libertatem vindicaret. See also Dio
Cass. 41 . 1 .—- provinciam: Caesar
was proconsul of Gallia Cisal·
pina, Illyricum, and Gallia Narbo-
nensis. — Curio meus: cf. Ep.
VII. 3 n. He advised Caesar to
advance upon Rome at once, with-
out waiting to offer a compromise.
— nulla vi expulsi: Antonius and
Q. Cassius, two of the tribunes,
vetoed the senatus consultum ulti-
mum (cf. introd. note), and al-
though such action was strictly
within the limits of their power,
serious threats were made against
them in the senate. Cf. Caes. B. C.
1. 2 refertur confestim de intercessi-
one tribunorum. Dicuntur seuten-
tiae graves .· ut quisque acerbissime
crudelissimeque dixit, ita maxime
ab inim icis Caesaris collaudatur,
and according to Dio Cassius 41.
