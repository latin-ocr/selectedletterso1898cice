XC. (Fam. 16. 21.)

CICERO F. TIRONI SVO DVLCISSIMO S.

Cum vehementer tabellarios exspectarem cotidie, 1
aliquando venerunt post diem quadragensimum et sex-

tum quam a vobis discesserant.

Quorum mihi fuit

adventus exoptatissimus 3 nam cum maximam cepissem
laetitiam ex humanissimi et carissimi patris epistula,
tum vero iucundissimae tuae litterae cumulum mihi

gaudi attulerunt.

cf. Ep. XXV. 2 n.—M. (Iunium)
Brutum: an authority on civil law,
upon which subject he composed‘
three books. -— Scaevolae : con-
sul in 133 B.C.‚ and frequently
quoted by Cicero as a legal au-
thority. —Testae : i.e. Trebatius.

XC. Athens, July-Oct.‚ 44 B.C.
On young Marcus, cf. Intr. 54.
The young man had been pursuing
his studies at Athens for about a
year and a half, but he was fonder
of the pleasures of life than of
study‚ and the reports which came
to the father from Leonides (cf.
Att. 14. 16. 33 15. 16 A.), under
whose special care he had been
put, were so unfavorable that
Cicero had considered the advisa-
bility of going to Athens to inves-
tigate the matter. In view of this
alarming possibility, the young
man wrote this letter to Cicero’s
confidential secretary, Tiro. This
and Fam. 16. 25 are the only
letters extant from a rather large
correspondence‚ known to the
ancients‚ of the young Marcus

Itaque me iam non paenitebat inter-

with his father and with Tiro.
Most of the stylistic peculiarities
of the letter may be classified
under the following categories:
(1) extravagance of statement; (2)
the use of Greek words; (3) a
tendency to use certain expres-

, sions otherwise rarely found out-

side the writings of the elder
Cicero ; (4) colloquialisms.

On dulcissimo, cf. Intr. 88 a.

1. post . . . sextum: the dis-
tance from Rome to Athens could
be covered in 21 days (cf. Intr. 64)
under favorable circumstances.
Possibly young Marcus had de-
layed in replying and wished to
conceal that fact. The archaic
form quadragensimum is suffi-
ciently supported by tricensima
(Ezm. 10. 31. 5) and quadra-
gensimo (Fam. 10. 33. 5). Cf. also
C.I.L. I. 198. 21 and 199. 27.
See also Crit. Append. — exopta-
tissimus: the generous use of
superlatives in the first sentence
illustrates well young Cicero‘s de-
sire to please his correspondent,
