138 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. XXXV.

De Memmio restituendo ut Curio cogitet te audisse
puto, De Egnati Sidicini nom-ine nec nulla nec magna
spe sumus, Pinarium, quem mihi commendaS, dili-
gentissime Deiotarus curat graviter aegrum. Respondi
etiam minori. Tu velim, dum ero Laodiceae, id est ad
Idus MaiaS, quam saepissime mecum per litteras collo—
quare et, curn Athenas veneris—iam enirn sciemus de
rebus urbaniS, de provinciis, quae omnia in mensem
Martium sunt collata -— utique ad me tabellarios mittas,
Et heus tu, iamne vos a Caesare per Herodem talenta
Attica L extorsistis? In quo, ut audi0‚ magnum odium
Pompei suscepistis; putat enim suos nummos vos come-
disse, Caesarem in Nemore aedificando diligentiorem
fore. Haec ego ex P. Vedio, magno nebulone, sed

of Hector, so the leading Opti—
mates were afraid to accept but
loath to decline Caesar's offers of
financial aid. In the one case they
would be under obligation to
Caesar; in the other they would
miss a chance of paying long out-
standing debts. Lentulus was one
of the men whom in the following
year Caesar sought to win over by
the means indicated3 cf. Att. 8. 1 1.

25. heus: confined to conver-
sational Latin, and commonly fol-
lowed or preceded by a pronoun
or the name of the person ad-
dressed, with a question or a com-

mand—Herodem: an Athenian
friend of Atticus and Cicero, and
afterwards in a certain sense the
guardian of young Cicero while the
latter was studying at Athens; cf.
Att. 14. 16. 3; 14. 18. 4.—suos
nummos: Pompey, for some un-
known reason, thought that this
money should have come to him
rather than to Atticus. -— Ne-
more: the grove of Diana, not
far from Aricia, near which Caesar
was building a villa (cf. Suet. lul.
46). Why Caesar was expected
to be more active in building after
losing part of his capital it is diffi-
cult to understand. As for Pom-
pey's feeling in the matter, perhaps
Caesar owed him money, and the
expenditure of a large sum upon
the villa near Aricia would lessen
the chances of payment. He
would in that case look with dis-
favor upon Caesar’s building plans.
Possibly‚ however, we should read
