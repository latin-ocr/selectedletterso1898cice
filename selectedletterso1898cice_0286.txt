204 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. LXV.

gratia vel fama populi R. parem, non posse prohiberi
re publica diutius. Nolet hoc temporis potius esse
aliquando beneficium quam iam suum. Dixi de Cae-
sare; nunc dicam de temporum rerumque natura.
Nemo est tam inimicus ei causae quam Pompeius
animatus melius quam paratus susceperat, qui nos
malos civis dicere aut homines improbos audeat. In
quo admirari soleo gravitatem et iustitiam et sapi—
entiam Caesaris: numquam nisi honorificentissime
Pompeium appellat. ‘At in eius persona multa fecit
asperius.' Armorum ista et victoriae sunt facta, non
Caesaris At nos quemadmodum est complexus! Cas-
sium sibi legavit, Brutum Galliae praefecit, Sulpicium
Graeciae, Marcellum cui maxime suscensebat cum

summa illius dignitate restituit.
Rerum hoc natura et civilium temporum non

tant?

acterizes his pamphlet as a crimi-
nosz‘ssimus liber. — beneficium: a
tardy forgiveness would do little
credit to Caesar's generosity.

10. nos ε zle. the Pompeiam.—
in eius persona: with this use of
in Bockel compares Cic. Philipp.
14. 9 (animus) dicere reformidat
quae l.. Antonius in Parmensium
liberis et coniugibus qffecerioe and
on persona he cites appositely
Seyffert-Miiller on Lael. p. 21:
‘pe-mona, a term taken from the
masks used upon the stage, does
not mean the ‘⁴ person‘' in the
sense of the “individual ' (lzomo),
but refers always to the role which

, one takes, or to the external rela—

tions which position, rank, and
office suggest, to that which one
is, represents, or wishes to repre-
sent.' So here the reference is to
l’ompey as the political leader. —-
Cassium: in the Civil War C.
Cassius had commanded a part of

Quo igitur haec spec-

the Pompeian fleet (cf. Caes. B. C.
3. 101), but submitted to Caesar
soon after the battle of Pharsa-
lus. — Brutum: Caesar entrusted
M. Brutus with the province of
Cisalpine Gaul in 47 B.C.—Sul-
picium: cf. Ep. LXXV. introd.
note. At the outbreak of the
Civil War, Servius Sulpicius Ru-
fus, like Cicero, maintained a neu-
tral attitude‘, and after the battle
of Pharsalus withdrew even from
the scene of the struggle. At this
time he was governor of Achaia,
on Caesar’s appointment. — Mar-
cellum: M. Claudius Marcellus,
consu] in 51 B.C.‚ had been a bold
and consistent champion of the
senatorial party, had served under
Pompey in the Civil W’ar until the
battle of Pharsalus was fought,
and had then gone into voluntary
banishment to Mytilene. He was
pardoned by Caesar; cf. Fam. 4.
