Att. 4. 1.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 65

tem et adiungit classem et exercitum et maius imperium
in provinciis quam sit eorum qui eas obtineant. Illa
nostra lex consularis nunc modesta videtur, haec Messi
non ferenda. Pompeius illam velle se dicit, familiares
hanc. Consulares duce Favonio fremunt; nos tacemus
et eo magiS, quod de domo nostra nihil adhuc pontifi-
ces responderunt. Qui si sustulerint religionem, aream
praeclaram habebimUS‚ superficiem consules ex sena-
tus consulto aestimabunt; sin aliter, demolientur, suo
nomine locabunt‚ rem totam aestimabunt. Ita sunt res
nostrae, ‘ut in secundis fluxae, ut in adversis bonae.'
In re familiari valde sumUS, ut sciS, perturbati. Prae-

terea sunt quaedam domestica, quae litteris non com-

sius: a tribune and a follower of
Pompey; cf. Att. 8. 11 D. 2. -ma-
ius imperium in provinciis, etc.:
the bill of Messius would have sub-
ordinated Caesar to Pompey. —
consularis: because action was
proposed by a consul, not by a trib-
une, as in the case of the other law.
— Pompeius . . . hanc: a good
illustration of Pompey's political
methods.— Favonio: a man of
more energy than tact3 an admirer
and imitator of Cato. Although
only a quaestor, the boldness with
which he advocated the cause of
the Optimates brought even the
consulares to accept him as their
leader. He was praetor when the
C'ivil War opened, took Pompey‘s
side, and was pardoned by Caesar
after the battle of Pharsalus. He
fought on the side of the libera-
tores in the battle of Philippi, and
was put to death after the battle
by the order of Octavius.—-de
domo nostra: cf. Ep. XIII. 3 n.
Either the pontifices may decide
that the consecration by Clodius
was void (si sustulerint religio-

nem), return the site to Cicero,
and reimburse him for the loss of
his house; or they may consider the
consecration legal (sin aliter) and
indemnify him for the loss of both
house and grounds.

8. ut in secundis . . . bonae:
probably an iambic verse from an
old poet. The quotation occurs,
Att. 4. 2. 1, Ep. ad Brut. 1. 10. 2.
Cf. Ribbeck, Trczg. Rom. Frag.'p.
274.—in re familiari: cf. note
on 3 above—quaedam dome-
stica: the first reference in Cic-
ero’s letters to the trouble between
himself and Terentia, which led
eleven years later to a divorce.
Cf. Att. 4. 2. 7 (written a month
later) cetera, quae me sollicitant,
μυστικώτερα sunt .· amamur α fratre
et a filia. The omission of Te-
rentia's name here is very signifi-
cant. The reference to domestic
troubles immediately after a state-
ment concerning the unsatisfac-
tory condition of his property
lends color to the hypothesis that
the reckless management of Cic-
ero’s property by Terentia and her
