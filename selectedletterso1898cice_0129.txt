recommends walking, among other
things, as good for the voice.—

Emesa, which Pompey had con-
quered. Elsewhere (Att. 2. 17. 3)

dictavi: Tiro, Cicero's principal
secretary, was an expert shorthand
writer and the author of a system
of stenography. Cf. Intr. 57. —-
haec dictavi ambulans: no better
proof could be required that Cic-

ero did not intend his letters for <

publication than the fact that many
of thern were composed while on a
journey, or just as the vessel is
weighing anchor, between the
courses at dinner, or while the
messenger is impatiently standing
behind him with cloak and hat
on. Cf. Ep. LXX. 1. To his
brother, who had complained of the
illegibility of his letters, he writes:
sed hocfaczo semper, ut quecumque
caltlnlus ln manus nlCClS veneni,
eo sic utar tamquam bono, Q. fr. 2.
14. 1. Cf. also ante lucem, Ep.
XVI. 7 and Intr. 64.

2. Sampsiceramum: a nick-
name several times applied to
Pompey (cf. Att. 2. 17. 1). Samp-
siceramus was the petty ruler of

Pompey is alluded to as Arabar-
clzes, the despot of eastern Egypt,
or Hierosolymarius, ‘the Jerusa-
lemite ' (Att. 2. 9. 1) from his cap-
ture of Jerusalem. The applica-
tion of these nicknames to Pom-
pey suggests that after his return
from the East, he assumed an arro-
gant and autocratic manner more
befitting a petty eastern despot
than a Roman citizen. The very
sound of the nicknames would
also suggest his pompous manner.
—ex quo decidit: cf. quia de-
ciderat ex astris, Att. 2. 21. 4.
—medicinam . . . quaerere: a
favorite metaphor, not only with
Cicero but with other Roman
writers; developed at great length,

for instance, by Servius Sulpicius

in Ep. LXXV. 5. Cf. also Intr.
993. desiderio versamur: i.e. I
am haunted by a painful remem-

brance of my past achievements.
