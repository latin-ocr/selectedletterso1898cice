18 ⁴ CICERO'S LETTERS.

[Ep. v.

clamoribus maximiS, cum accusator tamquam censor
bonus homines nequissimos reiceret‚ reus tamquam
clemens lanista frugalissimum quemque secerneret, ut
primum iudices consederunt, valde diffidere boni coepe-

runt.

Non enim umquam turpior in ludo talario con-

sessus fuit: maculosi senatoreS, nudi equiteS, tribuni
non tam aerarii quam, ut appellantur, aerati3 pauci
tamen boni inerant, quos' reiectione fugare ille non

voluntate, Ep. II. 1 n.—accusa-
tor: L. Lentulus Crus. —lanista:
an owner and trainer of bands of
gladiators. As the kind-hearted
lanista avoids sending his best
gladiators into encounters where
they will be sure to lose their
lives, so the defendant avoids
sending honest men into a jury-
box where they will lose their rep-
utation. For another explanation,
see Tyrrell. The correlation of ut
faeta est and ut primum . . .
consederunt would not be found
in careful prose.— in ludo talario:
the vestis talaris reached to the
ankles, and was not worn by re-
spectable people (cf. Gell. 6. [7.]
12), and a ludus talarius was
probably an entertainment of a
low class where the performers
wore this garment3 cf. Fronto,
Ep. p. 160 N aber laudo censoris
illud, qui ludos talarios (ffageret),
quod semet zpsnm diceret, eum ea
praeterisset, difficile dignitati ser-
vire, quin ad modum crotali aut
cymbali pedem poneret. — macu-
losi: perhaps in its general sense,
perhaps with special reference to
men after whose names the censors
had placed a nota. -— nudi, desti-
tute; cf. inopiam, 2 n.—-tribuni

. aerati: this is difficult to
understand. The common read-
ing is, non tam aerati . . . aera-
rii. The term aerarii was some-

times applied to citizens of the
lowest class, outside the limits of

the centuries of the Servian con· '

stitution, the ⁶ riffraff’ of the pop-
ulation; and the'phrase is under-
stood as meaning, ‘not so much
tribunes with money (aerati) as
tribunes without money or repu-
tation (aerarii).’ The objections

*to this explanation are that the

point is obscure, and that in a list
of the three classes of people
composing the jury, where the
technical designations have been
used in two instabees, we expect
to find the third term used, and
used in the technical sense, i.e. we
expect senatores . . . equites, tribuni
non tam aerarii. The transposi-
tion by a copyist of aerarii (or
aerari, as the MS. really reads)
and aerati would not be unnatural.
If we may adopt the reading non
tam aerarii. . . aerati, the expres-
sion would mean ‘not so much
tribunes who have money (for the
tribuni aerarii had money in
their charge) as tribunes who are
to be lead for money (aerati).’
This reading brings into relief the
essentia] point, viz. the venality
of the judges. This conjecture

, was first put forward by Muretus.

Cicero is quoting one of those
witticisms current in Rome which
are so frequent in his letters; ‘ not
so much tribuni aerarii as, to'
