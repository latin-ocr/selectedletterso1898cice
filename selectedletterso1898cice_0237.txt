Martias, in quibus scribis Caesarem apud Corfinium
castra posuisse. Quod putavi et praemonui fit, ut nec
in praesentia committere tecum proelium velit et omni-

XLIV. Luceria, Feb. 17, 49 ΒΕ.
Caesar crossed the boundary of
his province Jan. 10, 49 B.C. (Nov.
22, 50 B.C., according to the Julian
calendar), with a force of five
cohorts‚ which had increased to
40‚ooo men by Feb. 14, when he
arrived before Corfinium. In this
town and its vicinity there were
thirty-one cohorts (cf. Att. 8. 12 A.
1), mainly under the command of
L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (cf. Ep.
Ι. 3 n.)‚ designated as Caesar's
successor in Transalpine Gaul.
Confidently expecting the arrival
of Pompey, to whom he had sent

letters describing his imminent
danger, Domitius had neglected
all preparations for defense. This
letter from Pompey, declining to
come to his relies, decided the
fate of the town, which was de-
livered over to Caesar after a
siege of seven days. Thus the
last obstacle in the way of Caesar's
advance into southern Italy was
removed. The intense interest
with which the Pompeians watched
the course of events at Corfi-
nium indicates the supreme im-
portance which they attached to
that struggle, and makes this let-
ter one of the most important
documents relating to the Civil
War. Dz· inmortales, qui me leor-
ror pmfudit! quam sum sollicitus
quidnam futurum sit, writes Cic-
ero (Att. 8. 6. 3), upon hearing
that Corfinium was besieged by
Caesar. For the details of the
siege, cf. Caes. B. C. 1. 19 ff.
