CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Multa me sollicitant et ex rei publicae tanto motu et
ex iis periculis quae mihi ipsi intenduntur et sescenta
sunt ; sed mihi nihil est molestius quam Statium manu

missum:

N ec meum imperium, —— ac mitto imperium: non simultatem meam
Revereri saltem! '

Nec quid faciam scio neque tantum θεῖ in re quantus

est sermo, Ego autem irasci ne possum quidem iis quos ,
valde amo, Tantum dole0‚ ac mirifice quidem. Cetera .-

in magnis rebus Minae Clodi contentionesque, quae
mihi proponuntur, modice me tangunt. Etenim vel

VII. Rome, July, 59 13.c. In
accordance with the compact made
in 60 B.C. between Caesar, Pom-
pey, and Crassus, who formed
what is commonly called the First
Triumvirate, Caesar had been
elected consul for 59 B.C.‚ and the
radical measures whose passage
he had secured or was securing
with the help of Pompey (cf. Att.
2. 16. 2) opened Cicero‘s eyes to
the character of Pompey, and to
the danger which threatened the
state. The letter presents a lively
picture of the political turmoil in
Rome, throws light upon the atti-
tude of the populace toward Cae-
sar and Pompey, as viewed from
an aristocratic standpoint, and dis-
closes Cicero's realization for a
moment of the danger with which
the designs of Clodius threaten
him.

1. sescenta: cf. miliens, Ep.
V. 4 n.—— Statium manu missum
(esse): Quintus Cicero had Iately
set his slave Statius free, and this
action had given color to the ru-
mor that Statius exerted too great
an influence over Quintus. Cf. Q.

movere solebat, cum audiebam illum

plus apud te posse quam gravitas ⁵

urn, etc.: from Ter. l'lzorm. 232.
—mitto‚ I waz've. — revereri: an
exclamatory infinitive expressing
indignation. -— ego autem, etc. ε
perhaps a general statement, or
Cicero may refer to his brother
alone, as on grounds of politeness
or discretiori he often employs the

plural when thinking of a single .

person. — cetera, etc. ε pointing
