214 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. LXIX.

scribat ad te; eique interea aut scribes salutem aut
nuntiabiS, itemque Piliae. Et tamen, etsi continuo
congressuri sumUS, scribes ad me si quid habebis,

Cum complicarem hanc epistulam, noctuabundus ad
me venit cum epistula tua tabellariUS, qua lecta de
Atticae febricula scilicet valde dolui. Reliqua quae
exspectabam ex tuis litteris cognovi omnia. Sed quod
scribis ‘igniculum matutinum Ὑεροντικόν,’ Ὑεροντικώτε-
ρον est memoriola vacillare. Ego enirn 1111 Kal. Axio
dederam, tibi 111, QuintO, quo die venissem, id est
prid. Kal. Hoc igitur habebis, Novi nihil. Quid ergo
opus erat epistula? quid, cum coram sumus et garri-
mus quicquid in buccam? Est profecto quiddam λέσχη,

osculum—scribes . . . nuntia-
bis: Cicero is uncertain whether
Pilia and Attica are in the country
or with Atticus in Rome.—scri-
bes: cf. Intr. 84 b.

2. complicarem: the technical
word for fastening a letter. —
noetuabundus, aster travelling all
nzgrlzt long ,· found nowhere else in
Latin, nor is there a verb noctuam
known. Adjectives in -bumlus be-
long exclusively to archaic or vul-
gar Latin. Gellius (N A. 11. 15)
indicates correctly the force of the
ending. —- febricula, slzgrlzt attach
of sever. — sed quod scribis,
etc.‚ but as for your writz'ng that
⁴ a bit offire in tlte morning is a
szgrn of 0ch age,’ it is a sztrer szgrn
when one's memory is weczle and
tottering. Cicero was about to
visit Atticus, and had asked him
to have a little fire for him in the
morning. This request Atticus
makes the basis of a sally at his
expense, upon which Cicero re-
torts3 for, as he goes on to say,
he had written to Atticus that
he should spend with him the

third day before the Ka1e‘nds‚ but
Atticus had forgotten the day, and
thought Cicero was to be with
him on the fifth day before the
Kalends. - memoriola : the large
number of diminutives for so short
a letter, litterularum, tgniculum,
and memoriola, is worthy of note.
All three of these words are rare,
and have not only a diminutive
force but express other shades of
meaning, eg. memoriola expresses
commiseration and sympathy.—
dederam: the object is 1111 Kal„
i.e. quartum Istat—quo die ve-
nissem: sc. Romarm—hoc igi-
tur habebis, take tltat men,- a
phrase from the arena, of one who
has received a telling thrust or
blow. hoc refers to γεροντικῶ-
τερον . . . vacillare. On habebis,
cf. habes, Ep. XC. 7 n. — garri-
mus: a colloquial word prop-
erly applied to the chattering of
children, as in 1.—quicquid in
buccam (venerit): the vulgar ex-
pression for quicquid in mentem
venerit. The same phrase is found
in Att. 1. 12.4; 7. 10; 14. 7. 2. In
