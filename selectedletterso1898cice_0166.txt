84 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. XIX.

equitatus in aliqua pugna ? Quae popularem admiratio-
nem habuerunt, delectationem tibi nullam attulissent.
Quod si tu per eos dies operam dedisti Protogeni tuo,
dummodo is tibi quidvis potius quarn orationes meas
legerit, ne tu haud paulo plus quam quisquam nostrum
delectationis habuisti; non enim te puto Graecos aut
Oscos ludos desiderasse, praesertim cum Oscos vel in
senatu vestro spectare possiS‚ Graecos *ita non ames ut

ne ad villam quidem tuam via Graeca ire soleas,

Nam

quid ego te athletas putem desiderare, qui gladiatores

contempseris ?

stage. Compare with this whole
passage the trenchant criticism
which Horace passes upon the
taste for realism and vulgar dis-
play upon the stage in his day
(Ep. 2. 1. 189—207).

3. Protogeni: the slave who
read aloud to Marius. — ne tu: cf.
ne, Ep. XVII. 2 n. —- Graecos aut
Oscos ludos : comedy and tragedy
were essentially of Greek origin,
and Cicero speaks of them there-
fore as ludi Graeci in distinction
from the fabulae Atellanae (ludi
Osci), which were indigenous to
Italian soil. These Atellan farces
were comic representations of life
with fixed characters. They were
cast in dialogue form, varied by
occasional songs. The action was
lively, and the language the vulgar
Latin. After the conquest of Cam-
pania, in 211 B.C., these farces were
introduced into Rome, given in
course of time a more distinctly
dramatic form, and used as after-
pieces on the stage. Cf. Ep. LXI.

council, probably in Pompeii, and
in the deliberations of his Oscan
colleagues upon petty matters of
town government‚ he could find all
the elements of an ‘Oscan bur-
lesque ' without taking the trouble
to come to Rome for thern. —via
Graeca: perhaps a road leading
to his villa which Marius did not
use; but the point of the jest is
obscure to us. —- athletas: a term
applied properly to those who took
part in the five contests — running,
wrestling, boxing‚ the pentathlum
(made up of five distinct games),
the pancratium (boxing and wres-
tling). As we may infer from the
text, in quibus, etc.‚ the Roman
people showed little enthusiasm
for these Greek games, and this
continued to be the case until
they gained an artificial stimulus
by receiving the approval of cer-
tain emperors. Nero in particular
was very fond of them (Tac. Ann.
14. 20). —- gladiatores: on Cie-
ero’s own distaste for gladiatorial
contests‚ cf. Att. 2. 1. 1 Kal. Iuniis
