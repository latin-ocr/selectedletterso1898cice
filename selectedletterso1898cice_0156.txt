74 ⁷ CICERo’s LETTERS.

[Ep. XVIII.

et Piliam adducere; ita enim et aequum est et cupit

Tullia.

Medius fidius ne tu emisti ludum praeclarum;

gladiatores audio pugnare mirifice. Si locare voluisseS,

duobus his muneribus liberasses,

Sed haec posterius

Tu fac venias et de librariis, si me amas, diligenter.

XVIII. (Fam. 5. 12.)

M. CICERO S. D. L. LVCCEIO Q. F.

Coram me tecum eadem haec agere saepe conantem
deterruit pudor quidam paene subrustiCUS, quae nunc

locum tam prope Romam ubi multi
sint qui Vatinium numquam vide-
rint! ubi nemo sit praeter me qui
quemquam ex vigintivim's vivum et
salvum velit. Cf„ however, Intr.
50.— Piliam: cf. in eius nuptiis,
Ep. XVI. 7 n.-medius fidius:
for ita me deus fidius adiuvet.—
ne : the emphatic particle. -— tu
emisti ludum praeclarum, you
lzave bought ιι splendid band (of
gladiators). Atticus would seem
to have bought a¹troop of gladia-
tors, whom he was at present hav-
ing trained, that he might let them
out (locare) to the aediles for the
public games.—- pugnare: of prac-
tice contests.— duobus his rnu-
neribus liberasses: if we accept
this reading, the meaning perhaps
is: ‘from the results of the two
spectacles this year you might have
set (them) free.' For distinguished
bravery and skill gladiators at the
request of the people were some-
times presented with a rudis, or
wooden sword‚ and allowed to re-
tire from service. Cicero writes to
Atticus a few days later: tu scribas
ad me velim de gladiatoribus, sed
ita, bene si rem gerunt,· non quaero,
male si se gesserunt, Att. 4. 8 A. 2.
Boot believes that the gladiators

have turned out badly, and that
the passage is ironical: ‘if you
had been willing to let them out,
you might have set thern free
(from slavery, for they would have
been killed by their opponents).'

XVIII. Arpinum, June, 56 B.C.
A thorough analysis of this letter
to Lucceius, as Bo‘ckel points out,
will reveal the fact that it is as care-
fully constructed as any of Cicero's
orations: 1, prooemium; 2, 3, [κονία-
tio ,· 4-8, probatio ,· 9, 10, conclusio.
Yet, while the earnestness of his
purpose is apparent throughout, by
the light conversational tone which
he gives the letter Cicero glosses
over the ‘impudence' of his re-
quest, puts the seriousness of the
offense against historical truth in
the background‚ and strives to
secure the consent of Lucceius on
the score of friendship. For Cic·
ero’s own judgment of the epistle,
cf. Att. 4. 6. 4 epistulam, Lucceio
nunc quam misi, qua meas res ut
scribat roga sac ut ab eo sumas --
valde bella est. L. Lucceius was an
orator and a man of some literary
note. In politics and military
affairs he was less successful; he
was a candidate with Caesar for
