60 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. XV.

ut tibi absenti de reditu nostro gratularer; cognoram
enim—ut vere scribam—te in consiliis mihi dandis
nec fortiorem nec prudentiorem quam me ipsum, nec

- etiam pro praeterita mea in te observantia nimium in

custodia salutis meae diligentem, eundemque te, qui
primis temporibus erroris nostri aut potius furoris
particeps et falsi timoris socius fuisseS, acerbissime
discidium nostrum tulisse plurimumque operae, studi,
diligentiae, laboris ad conficiendum reditum meum con-
tulisse. Itaque hoc tibi vere adfirmO, in maxima lae-
titia et exoptatissima gratulatione unum ad cumu-
landum gaudium conspectum aut potius complexum
mihi tuum defuisse; quern semel nactus numquam di-
misero ac, nisi etiarn praetermissos fructus tuae suavi-

absenti: Atticus was in Epirus.
—cognoram enim: the reason

931; illud non nimium probo, ‘I
don‘t particularly approve of it‚’

for the congratulation‚ which is
the main thought, is contained in
the second infinitive clause, eun-
dem te . . . contulisse; the
first infinitive clause, te . . . dili-
gentem, which is concessive, and
therefore logically subordinate, is
in a free way made coordinate
with the other.-—nec fortiorem,
etc.: in Att. 3. 15. 4 also Cicero
reproaches Atticus for a lack of
wisdom and bravery: sed tu tantum
lacrimas praebuisti dolori meo. Cf.
tam timidi, Ep. XIII. 1 n.—nec

. nimium diligentem: this
means in formal Latin, ‘not too
active‚' but here it means, ‘not
very active,' without any idea of
excess, or, as we say, ‘none too
active. This use of ni',mzum
m'',mm and mmis is frequent in
colloquial Iatin. Cf. homo ni'mt-
um lepistdus a very charming man '
(not‘ too charming a man ⁹), Plaut.
Mil. 99& locos nimium mirabilis,
⁴ exceedingly strange places‚’ Trin.

Cic. Fam. 12. 30. 7. Cf. also Intr.
90. —— erroris nostri : in assuming
that the first bill of Clodius, which
did not mention Cicero by name,
was directed against him, and in
confessing thereby its applicability
to him. Cf. Ep. X„ introd. note.
—— plurimum operae, etc.: dun'ng
Cicero's exile Atticus not only
made the best use of his wide
acquaintance with politicians of
all factions to secure Cicero's re-
call (cf., eg„ AIetello, Ep. XIV.
2 n), but also aided Cicero's fam-
ily, which was in financial straits
(Ep. XIII.).

2. quern: antecedent in tuum.
—dimiseroz in early Latin the
fut. perf. did not involve the idea
of completion before the occur-
rence of another event (cf. F. Cra·
mer, Arclz f. lat. Lex. IV. 594-
598), so that Plautus writes, leuc
aliquantum abscessero, Tun. 62 5,
