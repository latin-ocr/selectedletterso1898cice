TVLLIVS ET CICERO TERENTIA TVLLIA QQ. TIRONI
S. P. D.

Etsi opportunitatem operae tuae omnibus locis desi· 1
der0, tamen non tam mea quam tua causa doleo te non
valere; sed quoniam in quartanam conversa vis est
morbi (sic enim scribit Curius), spero te diligentia
adhibita iam firmiorem fore3 modo fac, id quod est
humanitatis tuae, ne quid aliud cures hoc tempore
nisi ut quam commodissime convalescas, Non ignoro
quantum ex desiderio labores ; sed erunt omnia facilia,
si valebis, Festinare te nolo ne nauseae molestiam

XLII. Near Rome, Jan. 12,
49 B.C. Cicero reached Rome,

it was voted uti ante certam diem
(July Ι, 49) Caesar exercitum di-

after his absence in Cilicia, Jan. 4,
49 B.C. (cf. 2), but, being anxious
to obtain a triumph, remained
without the city. This enabled
him to avoid participating in the
exciting debates which took place
in the senate Jan. 1—2 and 5-6,
and left him free to negotiate for
peace between Caesar and Pom-
pey. On Jan. 1 Curio, Caesar's
representative, laid before the
senate a proposition to the effect
that Caesar should be allowed to
sue for the consulship while absent
from the city, in accordance with
the special law passed in 52 B.C.
granting him that privilege (cf.
Intr. 26), or if it should be con-
sidered necessary for him to give
up his army and provinces, that
Pompey should be required to do
the same. Although this docu-
ment was read in the senate, the
consuls refused to allow a vote
upon it, and after fiery speeches
by Lentulus, Scipio, and others,

mittat ,· sz' non saciat, eum adversus
rem publicam fizcturum videri
(Caes. B. C. 1. 2). After consulta-
tions with Pompey, whose impe-
rium, as he was still governor of
Spain, did not allow him to enter
the city, on Jan. 7 the senate passed
the senatus consultum ultimum .·
dent operam consules praetores tri-
buni plebis quique pro consulibus
sint ad urbem, ne quid res publica
detrimenti capiat (Caes. B. C. Ι.
5).—QQ.: cf. Ep. XL. introd.
note.

1. doleo . . . valere: that while
the course of political events was
of such absorbing interest at
Rome, Cicero's thoughts are first
directed towards Tiro and Tiro's
illness, affords a striking proof of
his affection for his faithful freed·
man.— quartanam : the appear-
ance of the febris quartana indi-
cated convalescence. Cf. Juv. 4.

57 quartanam sperantibus aegris.
