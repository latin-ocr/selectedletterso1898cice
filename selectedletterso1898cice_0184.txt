102 C1CERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. XXV.

cautior quam in advocationibUS, qui neque in Oceano
natare volueris, studiosissimus homo natandi, neque
spectare essedariOS, quem antea ne andabata quidem
defraudare poteramus, Sed iam satis iocati sumus,
Ego de te ad Caesarem quam diligenter scripserim, tute
sciS, quam saepe, ego ; sed mercule iam intermiseram,
ne viderer liberalissimi hominis meique amantissimi
voluntati erga me diffidere. Sed tamen iis litteris quas
proxime dedi putavi esse hominem commonendum. Id
feci3 quid profecerim facias me velim certiorem, et simul
de toto statu tuo consiliisque omnibus3 scire enirn
cupio quid agas, quid exspectes, quam longum istum

Romans. See Intr. 99. — cautior,
more discreet. Cavere as a legal
term means, ⁴ to provide for a per-
son‚' as his counsel. Cicero sug-
gests that Trebatius showed more
discretiori as a soldier, in keeping
out of range, than he did as a law-
yer. The same pun occurs in an-
other letter to Trebatius (Fam. 7. 6.
2) tu, qui ceteris cavere didicisti, in
Britannia ne ab essedariis decipia-
ris caveto. One of the main sources
of humor in Cicero’s letters to
Trebatius lies in the double mean-
ing which he gives to judicia]
terms,— a form of wit which would
appeal forcibly to the legal mind
of Trebatius ; cf. placebat and
censeo above and respondere in
the foregoing letter. Cf. also Cic.
Plzz'llpp. 2. 7 quam multa ioca so-
lent esse in epistulis qaae, prolata
si sint, inepta zv'deanturl— qui . . .
volueris: a humorous way of say-
ing that Trebatius avoided ’ the
dangers and hardships of the Brit-
ish campaign by staying in Gaul.
See in Britanniam, 1 n.—-studi-
osissimus homo natandi: Tre-
batius's fondness for swimming

Horace wittily uses for his own
purposes in Sat. 2. 1. 8. -spec-
tare: cf. τῶν Βρεττανῶν, Ep.
XXIV. 1 n.·— andabata: Treba-
tius had been so fond of combats
in Rome that his friends had not
been able to keep him away, even
from the shows where blindfolded
warriors fought on horseback. It
is strange, therefore, that he feels
so little interest in seeing similar
contests in Britain. The essedarii
were especially dreaded by the
Roman soldiers. — defraudare: a
colloquial word, which, though
common enough in Plautus and
Terence, Cicero uses elsewhere
perhaps only in a proverbial ex-
pression, Or. 221.

3. mercule: this oath is found
in Cicero's correspondence in the
forms, hercules, mehercules (or
merentes), and mehercule (or mer-
cule). Cicero himself writes (Or.
1 57) mehercule libentius dixerim

quam mehercules, and the more ”

polished letter-writers of this pe-
riod seem to have agreed with

him.—horninem: cf. homini, Ep(

XVI. 6 n.
