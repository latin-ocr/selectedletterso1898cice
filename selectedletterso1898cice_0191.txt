XXX. Minturnae, about May 7,
51 B.C. Cicero apparentlyleft Rome
May 1, spent a day at his Tuscu-
lan villa with Philotimus, his busi-
ness agent, and Atticus (3), and
went thence to Minturnae by the
way of Arpinum and Aquinum (3).
He reached his destination‚ Lao-
dicea in Phrygia, July 31 (Att. 5.
15.EJ). With 3—5 of this letter,
cf. p. VI.

1. ego vero: these words imply
that Cicero has in mind a remark
in the letter of Atticus. Cf. Fam.
16.10.1.—ut . . . ne: ut ne is
frequent in Latin comedyin clauses
both of result and of purpose, and
the explanation would seem to be
that originally ne had purely a neg-
ative force in the combinatiomeg.
faciemus ut, quod viderit, ne viderit,
Plaut. M. G. 149; merito ut ne
dzcant, id est (mi in manu), Plaut.
Trin. ¹05· Colloquial language,
being conservative of old usages,
retained this archaism and others
after they had disappeared from
general use in formal language.
The separation of nt and ne is

remarkable, but finds parallels,
especially in Latin comedy: cf. ut
quom opus sit ne in mora nobis
siet, Ter. Ad. 354, and Plaut.
Μ. G. 149 (above); in fact, the
use of ut ne instead of ne makes
it possible to put ne in the middle
or near the end of the sentence,
and thus secure the desired em-
phasis upon the negation. Ac-
cording to Seyffert-Muller (on
Laelius, 305), ut ne frequently
appears in the language of the laws
where we should expect ne. This
coincidence between the legal and
colloquial style is due to the con-
servatism of each form of speech,
and is especially noticeable in the
letter from the jurist Sulpicius
(Ep. LXXV).

2. Annio Saturnino: probably
a freedman of T. Annius Milo.

dum mancipium, some satisfaire—

about to sell some property, and

of the validity of his title as was
