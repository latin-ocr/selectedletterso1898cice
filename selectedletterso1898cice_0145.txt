' CICERo’s LETTERS. 63

inopiam esse clamarent, cum per eos dies senatus de
annona haberetur et ad eius procurationem sermone
non 'solum plebiS, verum etiam bonorum Pompeius

vocaretur, idque ipse cuperet multitudoque a me nomi-
natim ut id decernerem postularet, feci et accurate
sententiam dixi, cum abessent consulares, quod tuto se
negarent posse sententiam dicere, praeter Messallam

result did not follow, there was a
popular reaction against him, led
by Clodius.-id ipse (sc. Pom-
peius) cuperet: in the latter part
of 58 B.C. Pompey and Clodius
had a violent quarrel, and were
still at enmity with each other.
Atticus might therefore have sup-
posed that the position, which was
to be offered to Pompey, since
it was the result of the agitation
led by Clodius, was distasteful to
Pompey—ut id decernerem,
that J should advocate tlzat course.
—quod . . . dicere: Cicero com-
ments bitterly upon the cowardice
of the Optimates in an oration
delivered a short time after this:
at enim non nulli propter timorem,
quod se in senatu tuto non esse
arbitrabantur, discesserunt. Non
reprehendo, nec quaero fueritne
aliquid pertimescendum ,· puto suo
quemque arbitratu timere oportere,
de Domo, 8. The entire sentence
beginning with eo biduo, with
its rapid succession of temporal
clauses, the rapidity of whose
effect is heightened by the use of
asyndeton, with its graphic de-
scription of the movements of the
populace, is calculated to present
the urgency of the popular de-
mand in a forcible manner. Cic-
ero seems to feel that his action
in coming forward as the cham-
pion of a measure which would
give Pompey extraordinary power,
and thereby offend the Optimates,

may appear unwise, and therefore
calls for justification. Its unwis-
dom would consist in its tendency
to estrange the Optimates at
the moment when Cicero needed
their help in getting indemnifica-
tion for the loss of his house
on the Palatine. It would also
seem inconsistent with Cicero’s
political principles to advocate
increasing the power of one of
the triumvirs. Cicero strives to
meet these two objections by pre-
senting the urgency of the case
and the fact, if we may accept it
as a fact, that Pompey’s appoint-
ment was favored by the Boni
(verum etiam bonorum). Bockel
acutely remarks that it may have
been the purpose of Clodius to
force Cicero to propose the grant
of extraordinary powers, in order
to compromise him in the eyes of
the aristocracy and the pontefices.
He certainly succeeded in putting
him in a dilemma: to oppose the
bill would have been to brave the
wrath of the people and the en-
mity of Pompey, who had labored
to secure his recall from exile; to
favor the measure was to antago-
nize the aristocracy.— quod . . .

Ep. I. 3 n. — Messallam: M. Va-
lerius Messalla Niger, consul in 61
B.C. He is highly praised by Cic-
ero, in Att. 1. 14. 6, for his integ-
rity. Messalla and Afranius were
supporters of Pompey. On Afra-
