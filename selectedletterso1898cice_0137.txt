CICERO'S LETTERS. J

Fam. 14. 2.] 55

XIII. (Fam. 14. 2.)

TVLLIVS S. D. TERENTIAE SVAE ET TVLLIOLAE ET
CICERONI SVIS.

Noli putare me ad quemquam longiores epistulas
scribere, nisi si quis ad me plura scripsit cui puto
rescribi oportere; nec enim habeo quid scribam, nec
hoc tempore quicquam difficilius facio, Ad te vero et
ad nostram Tulliolam non queo sine plurimis lacrimis
scribere; vos enim video esse miserrimas quas ego
beatissimas semper esse volui, idque praestare debui et,
nisi tam timidi fuissemUS, praestitissem. Pisonem no-

of the third book to Atticus, the
date is regularly given without ad.
The same statement is not true
of the letters to others during
this period. — Thessalonicae: cf.
Intr. 62.

XIII. Thessalonica, Oct. 5, 58
B.c. suis in the superscription is
plural because it belongs to both
the children. For variations of
this salutation‚ cf. Fam. 14. 1, 3,
and 6. The possessive pronoun
indicates familiarity‚ and Cicero
uses it in addressing the members
of his family only. It is used in
all the 24 letters to his wife, in Bk.
14, ad Fam„ with one exception:
in the fifteenth letter, Ep. LVIII.‚
which is cold and formal, he writes,
Tullius s. d. Terentiae. Upon the
significance of the possessive in
this use, cf. Fam. 16. 18. 1. In a
previous letter to his freedman
Cicero had written, Tullius Tironi
sal.‚ omitting Tiro's praenomen.
The latter evidently remarked up-
on the salutation as too familiar
for a letter from patron to freed-
man. Upon which Cicero put at
the head of his next letter the same

salutation, and added in the body
of the letter, Quid {gitur ,Ρ non sic
oportet .? equidem censeo sic,· adden-
dum etiam svo.

Ι. nisi si: apparently a favorite
pleonasm for nisi in the language
of everyday life3 see Intr. 101, and
cf. Reisig-Schmalz, Lat. Syn. note
612 d ; Schmalz, Jalzresb. Mann-
heim, 1881, p. 44. Schmalz says
that it has crowded the classical
nisi out of use in the Latin of the
Christian fathers. -nec . . . scri-
bam: note the difference in mean-
ing between που lzabeo quad scri-
bam, non lzabeo quid scribam, and
non lzabeo scribere. Cf. Ep. VIII.
6 n. - Tulliolam: see Intr. 53.
On the diminutive, cf. pulchellus,
Ep. V. 10 n. —tam timidi: Lucul-
lus had advised (Plut. Cic. 31) the
use of force in opposing Clodius.
Atticus and others had apparently
counselled moderation. Cf. Fam.
1. 9. 13; Att. 3. 15. 7. The change
to the plural is probably made to
include these two friends and oth-
ers who had advised a moderate
course.

2. Pisonem nostrum: cf. Intr.
