INTRODUCTION. XXXV

with hostile soldiers. At the same time Caesar’s critical
position in Egypt1 made it quite possible that the Pompeian
cause might succeed after all, in which case Cicero’s standing
would be still more precarious. His family affairs were
equally distressing: Tullia, his daughter, was most unhappy
with her husband Dolabella3 Terentia's management of his
property2 during his absence had caused him a deal of
vexation; an unfortunate misunderstanding had sprung up
with his brother Quintus.3

33. Cicero's anxiety in regard to his own position was
somewhat relieved in Sept., 47 B.C., by the arrival of Caesar,
who generously gave him permission to remain in Italy.‘¹
He wept almost directly to Rome, and his letters in the

main, up to the close of 46 B.C., were written either in that ,

city or at his vxillas at Tusculum and Cumae. The battle
of Thapsus was fought Apr. 6, 46 ss.c., and by it Caesar's
supremacy in Africa was established; but the tidings
of this important battle and even of the violent deaths⁵ of
the Pompeian leaders, Scipio, Petreius, Afranius, and Juba‚⁶
do not seem to have stirred Rome so deeply as the news
that Cato had taken his own life at Utica‚⁷ feeling that the
cause of the Republic was beyond hope. The little memoir
which Cicero wrote of his personal and politica] friend⁸
called forth opposition pamphlets from the Caesarians‚
Hirtius⁹ and Brutus‚1⁰ and even Caesar found time on the
eve of the battle of Munda to write an ‘Antiana' ¹¹

34. Cicero gave much of his time to literature during this
period. The Orator was written and the Brutus finished in
