4 CICERO’S LETTERS.

accuderim.
tatio,

[Ep. Ι.

Petitorum haec est adhuc informata cogi-
Nos in omni munere candidatorio fungendo

summam adhibebimus diligentiam et fortasse, quoniam
videtur in suffragiis multum posse Gallia, cum Romae
a iudiciis forum refrixerit, excurremus mense Septem- ,

bri legati ad Pisonem, ut Ianuario revertamur.
perspexero voluntates nobilium, scribam ad te.

Cum
Cetera

spero prolixa esse, his dumtaxat urbanis competitori-
bus; illam manum tu mihi cura ut praesteS, quoniam
propius abeS, Pompei, nostri amici: nega me ei iratum

res, and were under the charge of
curatores? Tyrrell from Momm.
St. R. 113. p. 454.-—accudex·im:
the conjecture of Boot (see Crit.
App.) ; a Plautine word.-— infor-
mata cogitatio, general impres-
sion. — Gallia (Cispadana): it pos-

sessed the right of suffrage; cf.v

‘Plzih 2. 76 municipia coloniasque
Galliae a qua nos . . . petere con-
sulatum solebamus.—cum . . .
refrixerit, wlzen tlte lzeat of busi-
ness in tlte courts at Rome shall
lzave cooled down. On refrixerit,
cf. Intr. 99. — mense Septembri:
the ludi llffagni or Romani began
Sept. 4 and lasted 15 days, and
later in the year came the ludi
Plebeiz‘, the Saturnalia, etc„ so
that little legal business could be
done between Sept. 1 and Jan. 1.—
legati: the—reference is to a legatio
libera, an unofficial embassy. Sen-
ators favored with such a privilege
could travel for their own pleasure
or profit with the title and the
rights of a lagatus, and receive
supplies from government agents
without performing any official du-
ties. The provinces found this
senatorial junketing such a bur-
den that Cicero in his consulship
placed certain limitations upon it.
- Pisonem: proconsul in Gallia

Narbonensis. He was afterwards
defended by Cicero against ach arge
of maladministration (repetundae)
while governor of this province.
—voluntates nobilium: the aris-
tocracy were probably at this mo-
ment little inclined to support
Cicero’s candidacy‚ and voted for
him the next year only because he
was the candidate most likely to
defeat Catiline and the democrats.
—his . . . competitoribus, pro-
vided tlzat civilians are my only
rivals,· for if some one returns
from a successful military carn-
paign to stand for the consulship,
the result will be more uncertain.
—manumz the support of Pom·
pey. By the provisions of the
Manilian law, Pompey had the
year before been given charge of
the war against Mithridates. Cice-
ro's advocacy of that bill would
naturally secure for him Pompey's
support in the consular election.
Atticus, who was at this time in
Athens, and therefore nearer than
Cicero to Pompey, was asked
to make sure of Pompey’s assist-
ance; or, perhaps, as Tyrrell thinks,
manum refers to the followers of
Pompey, some of whom might

return to Rome in time for the ι
ο election.
