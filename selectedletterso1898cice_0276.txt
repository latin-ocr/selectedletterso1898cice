fui. Ceteri quidem, PompeiUS, Lentulus tuus, Scipio,
Afranius foede perierunt. ‘At Cato praeclare.’ Iam
istuc quidem, cum volemUS, licebit; demus modo ope-
ram ne tam necesse nobis sit quam illi fuit, -— id quod
agimus. Ergo hoc primum] Sequitur illud: ipse melior
fio, primum valetudines-quam intermissis exercitationi-
bus amiseram; deinde ipsa illa, si qua fuit in me, facul-
tas orationis, nisi me ad has exercitationes rettulissem,
exaruisse-ty Extremum illud est, quod tu nescio an
primum putes: pluris iam pavones confeci quam tu
pullos columbinos, Tu istic te Hateriano iure delectaS,
ego me hic Hirtiano. Veni igitur, si vir eS, et disce a
me προλεγομένας quas quaeris; etsi sus Minervam.

on being elected augur (cf. Varr.

R. R. 3. 6. 6). Cf. also Hor. Sat.

used for the land which, after its
value had been estimated‚ had
been turned over to him as credi-
tor. Cf. bona perdas and aestima-
