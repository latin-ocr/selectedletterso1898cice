4. si ἀκενόσπουδος fueris: the
Favonius (Ep. XVI. 2). He was

Epicureans discouraged an active

participation in politics‚ and Cic-
er0, perhaps ironically, approves
of the consistency with which
Cassius puts into practice his new
faith by remaining at Brundisium,
remote from dangers and annoy-
ances, while Pansa had unwisely
stayed in Rome, the center of po-
litica] action, and given himself
annoyance by relieving the distress
of the unfortunate Pompeians.
LXXI. Rome (?), 46 B.C. P. Ser-
vilius Vatia Isauricus (the younger
man of that name), to whom Cic-
ero addressed Fam. 13. 66-72, was
in 46 B.C. proconsul of Asia. He
had been praetor in 54 B.C., and
consul in 48, and was an active
and influential member of the
party of the Optimates. He ap-
parently belonged to the extreme
wing of that party, as he is classed

Cicero’s colleague in the college
of augurs.

1. Caerelliae: a woman, prob-
ably about Cicero’s own age, of
whom we hear little up to the last
few years of Cicero's life, when an
intimate friendship sprung up be-
tween them. In Att. 13. 21. 5
Cicero calls the attention of Atti-
cus to the fact that Caerellia suc-
ceeded in getting a copy of the de
Finibus from the copyists of Atti-
cus before the book was published.
She attempted as a common friend
to bring about a reconciliation be-
tween Cicero and Publilia (cf. Att.
14. 19. 4; 15. 1. 4). Of Cicero’s
letters to her only this fragment
is preserved: haec (sc. Caesaris
tempora) aut animo Catonis ferenda
sunt aut Ciceronis stomacho (Quint
6. 3. 112). —nornina‚ debts.
