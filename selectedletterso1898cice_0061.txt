the members of one's household, closing formulae were
less frequently used. For instance, all of the seventeen
letters from Caelius ¹ close abruptly. The date and place of
writing, if indicated at all, are usually given at the end of
the letter, the name of the place being in the ablative
(sometimes with a preposition) or the locative, e.g. d. (i.e.
data, datae or datum) a. d. III. Non. Oct. Thessalonica,
XVII. K. Apr. Corduba, K. Oct. de Venusino, ex Arpinati
VI. Non„ data XVI. Kal. Sextiles Thessalonicae.

63. When a letter was ready to be sent, it was rolled up;
a thread was wound about the middle of it and sometimes
passed through the papyrus itself, and a seal was attached
to the ends of the string.2 The 5631 was the guarantee of
genuineness; so, for instance, upon one occasion, when
Cicero had opened some letters from Quintus to certain
friends, on the suspicion that they contained slanderous
remarks about himself, he was not afraid of the consequences,
because Pomponia, the wife of Quintus, who was not on
good terms with her husband, had her husband's seal and
would not object to sealing the letters agam-⁹³ The 5631
often had for its design the likeness of the owner4 or of
one of his ancestors.5 Wax was commonly used to receive
the impression, but sometimes Asiatic chalk.6 Upon the
outside of the roll the name of the person addressed was
written in the dative, sometimes with his title and the place
where he could be found, e.g. M. Lucretio stamini Martis
decurioni P077zpeiz'5.⁷
