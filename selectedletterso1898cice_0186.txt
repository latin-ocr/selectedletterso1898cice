104 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. XXVI.

habeto, non tibi maiori esse curae ut iste tuus a me
discessus quam fructuosissimus tibi sit quam mihi.
Itaque, quoniam vestrae cautiones infirmae sunt, Grae-
culam tibi misi cautionem chirographi mei.
velim de ratione Gallici belli certiorem facias; ego enim
ignavissimo cuique maximam fidem habeo, Sed ut ad
epistulas tuas redeam, cetera belle; illud miror: quis
solet eodem exemplo plures dare qui sua manu scribit?
Nam quod in palimpsest0‚ laudo equidem parsimoniam;
sed miror quid in illa chartula fuerit quod delere malu—
eris quam haec in nova scribere, nisi forte tuas formu-

Tu me

89), a lively colloquial expression
which is used frequently in the
Letters. Sic takes the place of an
object. Cf. Fam. 1. 7. 43 16. 4. 4;
Ep. LXI. 2. The construction is
indicated in Fam. 2. 6. 5 rmum lzoc
sic habeto, etc. Habere with the
force of scire or audivisse, though
found most frequently in the im-
perative, is not confined to that
mode. Cf. habes omnia, Att. 5. 20.
7; habes consilia nostra, nunc cogno-
sce de Bruto. Att. 5. 21. 10. Cf.
the English colloquial expression,
‘ you have it,’ i.e. you have the idea.
-- maiori curae: cf. Ep. XXV. 2n.
-vestrae cautiones . . . chiro-
graphi mei: ‘the guaranty·bonds
drawn up by you lawyers for your
clients are so poor that I arn afraid
your position will not be a stable
one if you depend upon your own
support. This letter, therefore, is
a guaranty, with a Greek coloring
to it, to be sure, of my support.'
Graeculam is very obscure, but
in the diminutive force the key to
the explanation seems to lie. Cf.
Tusc. Disp. 1. 86, where Cicero
characterizes the extravagant con-
gratulations which the Neapoli-
tans offered to Pompey on his
recovery after a dangerous illness

as ineptum sane negotium et Grae-
culum; and pro Flacc. 23 motus qui-
dam temerarius Graeculae contio-
m's. The assembly showed the
instability so characteristic of the
Greeks. The congratulations for
Pompey were marked by that
extravagance or lack of dignity
which one is accustomed to look
for in the Greeks. With this ex-
planation of Graeculam the mean-
ing is: ‘I send you therefore in
this letter, lacking as it may seem
in seriousness, because of its light
tone of raillery, a promise of my
support.' —— ignavissimo cuique:
Cicero cannot mean, as many sup-
pose, that he would like the evi-
dence of aspectator concerning the
Gallic war, because Caesar‘s Com-
mentaries were thought to put mat-
ters in too rose-coloreas a light. The
Commentaries were published two
years later.

2. cetera belle: sc. fuerunt.
Cf. sic, Ep. V. 3 n, and bellus,
Ep. XXIV. 2 n. — eodem exem-
plo, witlz identical contents. — sed
miror, ete.: the matter must have
been very poor which Trebatius
erased to make room for such a
letter as the one was which took
its place. -tuas formulas: at-
