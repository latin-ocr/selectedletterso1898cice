CICERO ATTICO SAL.

Magna mihi varietas voluntatis et dissimilitudo opi- 1
nionis ac iudici Q. fratris mei demonstrata est ex
litteris tuis, in quibus ad me epistularum illius exem-
pla misisti: qua ex re et molestia sum tanta adfectus,
quantam mihi meus amor summus erga utrumque ve-
strum adferre debuit, et admiratione, quidnam accidisset,
quod adferret Q. fratri meo aut offensionem tam gra-

vem aut commutationem tantam voluntatis,

Atque

illud a me iam ante intellegebatur, quod te quoque
ipsum discedentem a nobis suspicari videbam, subesse
nescio quid opinionis incommodae, sauciumque esse

VI. Rome, Dec. 5, 61 B.C. At
this time there had been a dis-
agreement of long standing be-
tween Quintus Cicero and his
wife Pomponia, who was the sister
of Atticus. On leaving Rome to
assume the propraetorship of Asia
in 61 13.C., Quintus had invited
Atticus to accompany him as
legatus, and Atticus had declined
the invitation (cf. Ep. V. 14).
This refusal and the suspicion
of Quintus that Pomponia was
abetted in her opposition by her
brother (cf. odiosas suspiciones, 1),
had led to such a serious breach
between the two men that Quin-
tus, as current rumor said, had
expressed himself very unfavor-
ably in regard to his brother-in-
law at Rome, and had actually left
the city without writing to him
(cf. 4). Atticus naturally felt ag-

grieved‚ and in his letter to Marcus
Cicero took occasion to remind
his friend of the services which he
had rendered him in the past (cf.
5). To avoid a misunderstand-
ing with Atticus, and to put his
brother’s conduct in a more favor-
able light, without aggravating
the quarrel between Quintus and
Pomponia, and without putting
Atticus in the wrong, constitute
the delicate task which Cicero
essays. With this letter cf. Ep.
XXX. 3, 4.

1. epistularum . . . exempla:
the letters which Quintus ad-
dressed to Atticus from Thessa-
lonica (cf. 4), which would seem
to have been very bitter in their
tone. Cf. cgffk’nsionem tam gravene,
below.— discedentem: sc. for Epi-
rus at the close of 62 or in the
early part of 61 B.C.(cf.Att. 1. 13. 1)'.
