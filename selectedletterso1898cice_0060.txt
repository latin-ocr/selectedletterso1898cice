formulae which varied according to the relations in which the
writer and recipient stood. Thus, in writing to an intimate

(ie. salutem dz‘cz‘t); or in a little more formal letter the prae-
nomen or cognomen of one or of both might be added, e.g.
M. Cicero S. D. A. Caecz·nae⁴ or Cicero S. D. M Fadio Gall0.⁵

In addressing the members of one's own family it was

and to Tiro. Among those used are the following: vale,
