xxii INTRODUCTION.

lus and the Optimates, Caesar secured the passage of an
agrarian law ¹ and bills ratifying Pompey's arrangements in
the East,2 while the people, under the leadership of the
tribune P. Vatinius, approved a bill assigning to Caesar,
from Mar. 1, 59 B.C., the provinces of Cisalpine Gaul and
Illyricum, with an army of three legions for five years, to
which the senate, apparently of its own motion, added
Transalpine Gaul and a fourth legion.3

14. After the return of Caesar, Cicero took little part in
politics. He did not sympathize with the uncompromising
attitude of the senate, he was hurt by the coldness of
Pompey towards himself, and disappointed by that leader's
selfish aims. While appreciating the irresistible power of
the Triumvirate, he saw a ray of hope in the apparent
unpopularity of the triumvirs‚‘² whose rule, he believed,
could not last long. Clodius continued straight on toward
his cherished purpose of avenging himself upon Cicero.
With that end in view he caused himself to be adopted
by a plebeian, Fonteius, and secured an election as tribune
for the year 58.

Cicero would seem to have been blind to his own danger.
He knew of the enmity of Clodius, but did not fear him, so
that he made no o'pposition to his adoption or his election‚
and as late as Nov., 59 ΒΩ, writes in a confident way of
the future.⁵ The conduct of Caesar, who appreciated
Cicero's danger, was most generous. He offered Cicero‘
the position of legatus in Gau1.⁶' This offer, however, Cicero
declined‚ as well as that of a legatio libera,⁶ and a position
on the commission to divide the public land in Campania.⁷
