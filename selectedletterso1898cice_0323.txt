praeconio, At vide quid suscenseat. Phameae causam 2
receperam, ipsius quidem causa; erat enim mihi sane
familiaris Is ad me‘venit dixitque iudicem sibi ope-

consilium iri necesse erat.

vus represented led apparently to
a correspondence between them
(cf. Tac. Dial. 18). As a poet,
Calvus belonged to the νεώτεροι,
(Att. 7. 2. 1), and was an inti-
mate friend of Catullus, the
leading representative of that
school. He died about 47 B.C.;
cf. Fam. 15. 21. 4. Calvus had
assailed Tigellius in a poem, the
first verse of which, preserved by
Porphyrio (Hor. Sat. 1. 3. 4), is as
follows: Sardi Tigelli putidum
caput venit (from veneo). On the
order Calvi Licini, cf. Galli
Canini, Ep. XIX. 4 n.-—Hipp0-
nacteo: Hipponax was a Greek
writer of lampoons. — praeconio :
the setting forth by an auctioneer
of the merits of his wares; sug-
gested by the line from Calvus.

2. Phameae: cf. Ep. LXI. 8 n.
Tigellius was annoyed at Cicero for
neglecting to act as the advocate of
Phamea‚ his grandfather (or uncle),
after having promised to do so
(cf. Att. 13. 49. 1).—ipsius qui-
dem causa: Phamea had prof—
fered his assistance to Cicero

during the latter's canvass for the
consulship (cf. Att. 13. 49. 1).—
P. Sestio: Sestius was apparently
charged with ambitus ,· cf. Att. 13.
49. 1.——in consilium iri: cum
iudices, de reo sententias laturi, in
unum coeunt, ire in consilium di-
cuntur (Manutius). Cf„ however,
Ep. V. introd. note—ille: i.e.
Phamea—sat bonum: this ar-
chaic form of satis (cf. Ter. And.
475) seems to be found with no
other adj. than bonus in Classical
prose; cf. pro Rosc. Am. 89;
de Or. 3. 84; Att. 14. 10. 1.—
unctorern: the reference is ob-
scure. Manutius suggests canto-
rem.——-Sardos venalis: the Sar-
dinian slaves were weak and sickly
because of the unhealthful climate
of their native country. Hence
the proverb : ‘ Sardi venales ‚· alius
alio nequior) Cf. Otto, Spricli-
wa‘rter der Ra'mer, 308-Οᾶῒο-
nem tuum: probably a political
biography of Cato. Cf. Intr. 33.
