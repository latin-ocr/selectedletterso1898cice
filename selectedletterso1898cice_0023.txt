prestige and its privileges were at stake in the trial. He
defended Cornelius Sulla against the charge of having
taken part in the Catilinarian conspiracy, although it is
probable that Sulla at least sympathized with the purposes
of the democratic leader.1 It may be said, and perhaps
with truth, that in all three cases Cicero appeared as a
lawyer and not in any sense as a politician. We cannot

interests would· be promoted by the success of that side.
What could be more natural than that Cicero, belonging to
the equestrian class, whose rights and privileges had been
so seriously curtailed in the aristocratic reaction of Sulla,
