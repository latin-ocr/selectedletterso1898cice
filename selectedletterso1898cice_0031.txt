personal victory for him, but also a political victory for the
Optimates. Through the favorable action of the ponti ces,
Cicero had recovered his building site on the Palatine and
damages for the loss of his house and villas. The unani-
mous acquittal, in Mar„ 56 B.C.‚ of P. Sestius, Cicero’s
foremost champion in 57 B.C., who was prosecuted on a
charge de ambitu et de vi, was a decided triumph for Cicero
and the Boni} Furthermore, there was a lack of harmony
in the party of the triumvirs. Emboldened by this state of
things, the senate, on Apr. 5, 56 B.c., adopted Cicero's
motion ut de agro Campano . . . Idibus Maiis referretur.2

The law at which this motion to reconsider was directed ⁴

was Caesar's agrarian law of 59 B.C., assigning lands in
Campania to Pompey’s veterans. Success in repealing this
law would also undoubtedly lead to an attack upon all the
legislation of the year 59 B.c.

by Cicero himself (Fam. 1. 9. 9): Quem (i.e. Quintam) cnm
in Sardinia Pompeius, paucis post diebus qaam Licca (the place
of conference with Caesar) discesserat, convenisset, ‘te,'
inquit, ⁶ ipsum cupio ‚· m'la‘l opportunius potuit accidere: nisi
cnm Marco fratre diligenter egeris, dependendum tibi est, qnod
mihi pro illo spopondisti) Quid multa ? questus est graviter ,-
sua merita commemoravit ,· qnid egisset saepissime de actis
Caesaris cnm ipso meo fratre quidque sibi is de me recepisset, in
memoriam redegit seque, qnae de mea salute egisset, voluntate
Caesaris egisse ipsum meum fratrem testatus est .· cicius causam
dignitatemque milii nt commendaret, rogavit, nt eam ne oppug-
narem, si nollem ant non possem taeri. This important
passage furnishes the explanation of that remarkable change
which Cicero's politica] attitude underwent in 56 Bc
Quintus had promised Pompey that his brother, if recalled,
would not oppose the triumvirs. As a man of honor,
