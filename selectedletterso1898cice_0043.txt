VIII. CICERO AND THE LIBERA TORES.

(Aet. 63—64. 13.c. 44—43. Epist. LXXXV.—C.)

36. Soon 'after the murder of Caesar, the assassins‚ or
the liberatores, as they were termed by Cicero, distrusting
the temper of the people‚ withdrew to the Capit01‚2 which
was guarded by the gladiators of D. Brutus. Here they
were visited in the evening by a number of prominent men,
among them being Cicero. He himself had had no part in
the formation of the plot which led to Caesar’s assassination
or in its execution,3 but his sati‘sfaction at the removal of
Caesar is plainly shown in a jubilant letter⁴ written to
L. Basilus, one of: the conspirators, probably on the day
of the assassination.

37. M. Antonius, who was Caesar's colleague in the
consulship, gained possession of all his private treasure and
political papers,⁵ but thought it wise to leave the adjustment
of affairs to the senate.6 The senate met Mar. 17, and
adopted Cicero's proposal to ratify Caesar's acts and to
grant amnesty to the conspirators.⁷ At the same time
arrangements were made for the burial of Caesar at the
public expense and for the publication of his will. The
funeral took place between Mar. 20 and 23,8 and the people‚
whose sympathy for Caesar was increased on hearing his
generous bequests to them, were inflamed to such a degree
