ribus amicis, id est cum libris nostriS, in gratiam; etsi
non idcirco eorum usum dimiseram, quod iis suscense-
rem, sed quod eorum me suppudebat. Videbam nimi-

- rum me in res turbulentissimas‘infidelissimis sociis

demissum praeceptis illorum non satis paruisse. Igno-
scunt mihi, revocant in consuetudinem pristinam teque,

fuisse. ’ Quamobrem, quoniam placatis iis utor, videor
sperare debere, si te viderim, et ea quae premant et ea

sive in Tusculano sive in Cumano ad te placebit sive,
quod minime velim, Romae, dummodo simul simus, per-
ficiam profecto ut id utrique nostrum commodissimum

esse diiudicetur.

friend of long standing.
hear of him through a collection
of books which he presented to
Cicero in 60 B.C. (Att. 1. 20. 7; 2.
1. 12). Like Atticus, he was an
