Q.fr. 2. 15.] CICERO’S LETTERS. 93

cum senatores et equites damnassent. Ego eodem die .
post meridiem Vatinium eram defensurus, Ea res
facilis est. Comitia in mensem Septembrem reiecta
sunt. Scauri iudicium statim exercebitur, cui nos non
deerimus, Συνδείπνους Σοφοκλέους, quamquam a te
factam fabellam video esse festive, nullo modo pro-
bavi. Venio nunc ad id quod nescio an primum esse
debuerit.
Timebam Oceanum, timebam litus insulae; reliqua non
equidem contemnO, sed plus habent tamen spei quam

timoriS, magisque sum sollicitus exspectatione ea quam

O iucundas mihi tuas de Britannia litteras! ·

jority of the senators and a ma-
jority of the knights voted for
conviction‚ a majority of the tri-
buni aerarii f'or acquittal. The
guilt or innocence of the accused
party was, however, decided by a
majority of all the iudices, and in
this instance there was a majority
of four for acquittal. The num-
ber of jurors sitting in a trial was
determined by the statute under
which the charge was brought; the
lowest number mentioned is 32, the
highest 75 (cf. Madvig, Verf. u.
Verw. II. 308).—Vatinium: P.
Vatinius had made himself noto-
rious during his tribuneship as
Caesar’s agent,but escaped punish-
ment for his misdeeds. In 57 B.C.
he failed as a candidate for the
aedileship. In 56 he appeared as
a witness against Sestius, whom
Cicero was defending, and Cicero
attacked him mercilessly. (Cf.
eg. pro Sest. 132 ff.; in Vat. lnterr.,·
Fam. 1. 9. 7; QJr. 2. 4. 1.) The trial
here referred to was on an accusa-
tion de sodaliciis in 54 B.C. Cicero
undertook the defense at Caesar's
request. For Cicero’s explanation
of his conduct, cf. Ezm. 1. 9. 19.
It is a significant fact that in his

letters to Atticus he nowhere men·
tions the matter. Fam. 5. 9, 10 A
and 10 Β are letters written to Cic-
ero in 45—44 B.C. by Vatinius.—
comitia . . . reiecta sunt: the
bribery scandals and the disturb-
ances in Rome actually caused the
postponement of the consular elec-
tions until July‚ 53. Cf. Dio Cas-
sius, 40. 17.—Scauri iudicium:
the charge of misgovernment in
Sardinia had been brought against
Scaurus in July‚ but the trial had
been postponed for 30 days.—
Συνδείπνους Σοῲοκλέους : perhaps
a translation of the Σύνδειπνοι of
Sophocles; cf. Ribbeck, Ram. Tra-
gallie, 620. During the summer
and autumn of 54 B.C. Quintus
devoted some time to the trans-
lation and adaptation of various
Greek plays, especially those of
Sophocles; cf. er. 3. 1. 13 and
Ep. XXIII. 7.

4. o iucundas . . . litteras:
Cicero had written in July (Ast.
4. 15. 10): ex Q fratris litteris su-
spicor idm eum esse in Britannia .·
suspenso animo exspecto quid agat.
Caesar was at this time making
his second expedition to Britain.
Quintus had transferred his ser·
