CICERO M. VARRONI S.

Ex iis litteris quas Atticus a te missas mihi legit,
quid ageres et ubi esses cognovi; quando autem te
visuri essemUS‚ nihil sane ex isdem litteris potui suspi-
cari. In spem tamen venio appropinquare tuum ad-
ventum3 qui mihi utinam solacio sit! Etsi tot tantisque
rebus urgemur, ut nullam adlevationem quisquam non
stultissimus spera-re debeat3 sed tamen aut tu potes
me aut ego te fortasse aliqua re iuvare. Scito enim
me, postea quam in urbem venerim, redisse cum vete-

politeness shown everywhere else,

later.

LX. Rome, close of 47 B.C. or
early part of 46. M. Terentius
Varro is a fine type of the old
Roman character, and one of the
most picturesque figures in the
later years of the republic. While
better known to us for his literary
work, he was by no means with—
out ability in politics and the art
of war. He espoused the cause
of the senate in the Civil NVar,
and was sent to Spain as Pom-
pey's legate. After the defeat of
Afranius and Petreius he was corn-
pelled to leave Spain, but Caesar
pardoned him, and chose him to
take charge of the library which
he intended to found. Having

scribed, but rescued by a friend.
He died in 27 B.C., in his ooth
year. He was a most fruitful
writer of both prose and poetry‚
leaving behind him 74 works, con-
taining some 620 books, dealing
with almost all the departments
of human knowledge,— with lit—
erature, history, jurisprudence‚
grammar, philosophy, geography,
and agriculture. Cf. Quint. 10. 1.
