not yet known to Cicero. Cf. in
lzac parte, 6 n. — Scipionem : cf.
Ep. I. 3 n. —- Fausto z Faustus,
the son of L. Cornelius Sulla,
was the son-in-law of Pompey.
The dat. Fausto for a Fausto
comes under the principle stated
by Madvig on de Fz'n. 1. 11 ‘that
the dative, when thus used, con-
tains some idea of advantage, so
that the thing is thought of as
having been done not only by some
one butfor some one, as with the
verb qzcaer0.’ —— Afranium : cf.
Aulifilium, Ep. V. 12 n. —— in Py-
renaeo: the hopes of the Pom-
peians were fixed upon relies from
Spain ; cf. dilectus enim magnos
habebam us putabam usque illum m e-
luere, si ad urbem ire coepisset, ne
Gallias amitteret, quas ambas lzal’et
inimicissimas praeter Transpada-
nos, cx Hispaniaque sex lqu'ones et
magna auxilia Afranio et Petreio
clzccibus habeta tergm, fiam. Ι 6. 1 2. 4.
—Trebonioz C. Trebonius was
rewarded for the services which he
rendered to Caesar during his tri-
bunate by being appointed as Cae-
sar’s legate in Gaul, where he was

still in command. Later he be-
came praetor urbanus, and through
Caesar’s influence propraetor of ·
Spain. He, however, joined the
conspirators against Caesar’s life
in 44 B.C. He was murdered in
Syria in the same year by Dola-
bella, being thus the first one of
the liberatores to suffer for his
connection with that plot. —— Fa-
bium: another of Caesar’s legates
in Gaul. The reports that he had
deserted‚ and that Trebonius had
been defeated, were without foun-
dation; cf. Caes. B. C. 1. 40.—
transisse, llas come over to our
side. The desertion of Labienus,
the most trusted and skilful of
Caesar’s lieutenants, gave the
Pompeians great hopes of further
defections from Caesar's forces,
and the air was full of rumors of
such desertions.-magnis copiis:
Afranius, Petreius, and Varro had
seven legions and a large number
of auxiliary troops in Spain; cf.
Caes. B. C. 1. 38. — Leptam: see
Ep. XXXV. 22 n. — litteras: the
letter has not been preserved. — ne
quo inciderem: cf. cognovi, etc., 5.
