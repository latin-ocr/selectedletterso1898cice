be excepted, as, perhaps, si . . . quae Lepido digna sunt,
perspecta lzabes (Lepidus,⁸ Fam. 10. 34. 4), this combination
is not strictly synonymous With the perfect. Cf. note to
sollicitum liabent, Epist. LI. 1. For the use of the future

perfect instead of the future, cf. note to dimisero, Epist.
XV. 2.

T lze A dverb.

85. (a) One of the most noticeable characteristics in the
syntax of the Letters consists in the use of the adverb
with esse. This usage is frequent in colloquial Latin of
all periods. It is commonly found With adverbs of place
(prope, praesto, procul, etc.)‚ and the general and particular
adverbs of manner (ita, contra, aliter, bene, recte, tuto, etc.) ;
e.g., sit modo recte in Hispaniis (Aa. 10. 12a. 2) 3 sed quidvis
est melius quam sic esse ut sumus (Fam. 16. 12. 4). In this
construction esse is something more than a simple copula.

(b) More rarely, but in a few clear cases, the adverb is
used in place of an attributive adjective3 e.g. meae ullae
privatim iniuriae (Lentulus, Fam. 12. 14. 3). Cf. also note
to circumcirca, Epist. LXXV. 4, and to sic, Epist. V. 3.

86. The Letters, in common With other literary com-
positions which affect the sermo cotidianus, admit the
paratactical arrangement more freely than formal Latin
does, This fact is evident (1) in the use of coordination
rather than subordination 3 e.g. lianc ergo plagam effugiper
duos superiores Marcellarum consulatus, cum est actum de pro-
vincia Caesaris, nunc incido iii discrimen ipsum (Aa. 7. 1. 5),
for eum effugissem, etc.; (2) in the paratactical use of the
subjunctive in certain common formulae, e.g.sac diligas
(Au. 3. 13. 2) ; (3) in the parenthetical use of certain verbs ’
of thinking, e.g. sed, opinor, quiescamus (Ast. 9. 6. 2);
