INTRODUCTION. li

MARCUS TULLqu T1Ro.

57. Tiro, the slave and freedman, deserves a place
among the members of Cicero’s family because of the
intimate terms upon which he lived with all the members
of it. He was his master’s secretary and accompanied him
wherever he went. Cicero's affection for him is evident
from the letters of Bk. 16, ad Fam„ most of which are
letters written to Tiro by Cicero. He was a man of
cultivation, and his criticism was of great service to Cicero,
who writes to him: tu, qui κανὼν esse meorum scriptorum
soles} He did some independent literary work in writing a
life of his patron,2 in making a collection of his witticisms‚3
and in editing a collection of stenographical abbreviations.
He apparently wrote some tragedies also.4

TITUS POMPONIUS ATTICUS.

58. Atticus was born in 109 13.c.,⁵ and spent his early life
at Rome; but the dreadful events which attended the war
between Marius and Sulla led him to withdraw from Rome
in 86 B.c. and take up his residence at Athens,6 where
Cicero made his acquaintance about 79 Rc. His father
left him 2‚000,ooo sesterces, and his uncle Q. Caecilius
10,000,000⁷ more. This property he found means of
increasing by judicious investments, as he managed the
business affairs of Cato, Hortensius, Cicero, and others,8
made loans to individuals and towns‚⁹ carried on the

business of a publisher,lo and even kept trained bands of
