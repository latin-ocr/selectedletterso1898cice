lxii INTRODUCTION.

of these are the character of the person addressed and his
relations to the writer, the subject or subjects discussed,
the occupation and culture of the writer, the time and place
in which the letter is written, and the other circumstances
attending the composition.

With local differences in familiar speech and with those
which time effectS‚ the student who confines his attention
to Cicero’s correspondence is not concerned‚ as the letters
fall within a period of twenty-five years, and were written
by men who spoke Latin as it was spoken in the city of
Rome. The other factors are of interest. One cannot fail
to notice the freedom and informality with which Cicero
writes to his friend Atticus or his brother Quintus, as com-
pared with the tone which he adopts to those less intimately
related to him. It is in the letters addressed to these two
persons that we find the greatest divergence from formal
standardS. The subject and purpose of a letter exert a
potent influence upon its character. The ‘open letter' to
Lentulus (Fam. Ι. 9), for example, which was to serve as a
political pamphlet, takes a tone entirely different from that
of the gossipy letters to Trebatius and Paetus. Most of
Cicero's correspondents were men of some culture, and
there is consequently a uniformity of style and a nearer
approximation to formal Latin than we should find in the
letters of uncultivated men, but in Pompey and Curius, for
instance, we find little suggestion of literary training, but
rather the flavor of the camp and of mercantile life. The
circumstances under which a letter is written influence per-
ceptibly the character of its language and style. This is
especially true of Cicero's own letters, because his nature
was peculiarly sensitive to the circumstances surrounding
him at the moment, and the letters which he wrote
while in exile (eg. Att. Bk. 3.), offer, in their laxity of
style, striking illustrations of the way in which the intensity
