Att. 2. 22.] CICERo’s LETTERS. 45

omnia, si te habebo, Multa per Varronem nostrum
agi possunt, quae te urgente erunt firmiora, multa ab
ipso Publio elici, multa cognosci, quae tibi occulta esse
non poterunt, multa etiam — sed absurdum est singula
explicare, cum ego requiram te ad omnia. Vnum illud
tibi persuadeas velim, omnia mihi fore explicata, si te

quam me ipsum. —— Varronem:
cf. intr. to Ep. LX. Varro was an

intimate friend of Pompey, and
could therefore be of service to
Cicero.

Pompeium, etc.: ‘I think that
if you are here, while Crassus is
urging Pompey on, you, who can
find out from the prime mover
himself through her of the ox-
eyes, with how much sincerity the
triumvirs are acting‚ I think, Ι say,
that we shall be either free from
annoyance or at least from mis-
conceptions.'— Crasso urgente:
the dislike which Crassus felt for
Cicero seems to date from 66 B.C.‚
when Cicero, in his speech for the
Manilian law, by exaggerating the
part which Pompey had played in
certain matters, had belittled the

open quarrel between the two men

9. 20. -Βοῶπινε Clodia, the 515-
ter of Clodius. This epithet of
Hera as applied to her has a
double meaning. On the one hand,
as with Hera, the brilliancy of
Clodia's eyes was one of her claims
to beauty. Cicero speaks of her
flagrantia oculorum, pro Cael. 49.
On the other hand, her will was
imperious, and her fondness to
control men and things as well
marked as was that of Hera. She
was the Lesbia of the poet Catul-
lus, and the mistress of the young
orator Caelius, by whom the let-
ters of Bk. 8, adFam. were written.
For a sketch of her life, cf. Bois-
sier, Cice'ron et ses Amz's, 174—186.
Cf. also Merrill's Catullus, Intr.
18 ff. She hated Cicero, and
knew and sympathized with her
brother's plans against him. Ap-
parently Atticus was one of her
friends.
