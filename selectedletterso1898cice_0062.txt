lvi INTRODUCTION.

64. Letters were often written by secretaries from dicta-
tion‚ but most of Cicero's letters to Atticus and Quintus
at least were written with his own hand3 for in 59 B.C. he
writes to Atticus: numquam ante arbitror te epistulam meam
legisse, nisi mea manu scriptam ¹; and in 49 B.C.: lippitudinis
meae signum tibi sit librarii manus ²,· and in 54 B.C. to
Quintus: scribis enim te meas litteras superiores vix legere
potuisse, in qao m'lzil eorum, mi frater, fuit quae putas ,· neque
enim occupatus eram neque perturbatus nec iratas alicui, sed
lzoc facio semper ut, quicunque calamus in manus meas venerit,
eo sic utar tamquam bono.3 During the latter part of his
life, however, especially during the years 44 and 43 B.C.‚
even the letters to Atticus were written by a secretary,⁴²
Cicero's principal secretary was Tiro. Mention is also made
of another, Spintharus by name.⁵

As there was no postal system at that time, letters had to
be sent by one's own messengers (tabellarii) or the messen-
gers of one’s friends. This made the composition of a letter
a more serious matter in Cicero's day than it is in ours.
But his letters were not always studied productioris: some
of them were written while he was traveling3 others between
the courses at dinner03 and he writes to Cassius⁷z praeposteros
lzahes tabellarios . . . cum a me discedunt, flagitant litteras . . .
atque id ipsum facerent commodius, si milti aliquid spatii ad
scribendum darent, sed petasati veniunt, comites aa' portam
exspectare dicunt. ’

Some idea of the speed with which letters were carried
may be gathered from the following instances: letters arrived
at Rome from Brundisium on the sixth day, from Sicily on
