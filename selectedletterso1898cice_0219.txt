Att. 6. 1.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 137

fui. Habes ad omnia, non, ut postulasti, χρύσεα
χαλκείων, sed paria paribus respondimus, Ecce autem
alia pusilla epistula, quam non relinquam ἀναντιφώνητον.
Bene mehercule proposuit Lucceius Tusculanum, nisi
forte dolet ei quod suo tibicine egebit. Velim scire
qui sit status eius, Lentulum quidem nostrum omnia
praeter Tusculanum proscripsisse audio, Cupio hos
expeditos videre, cupio etiam Sestium, adde sis Cae-
lium, in quibus omnibus est

Αἴδεσθεν μὲν ἀνήνασθαι, δεῖσαν δ’ ὑποδέχθαι.

For a similar comparison of his
peaceful achievements with the
military successes of Pompey and
others, cf. Ep. III. 3; in Cat. 4.
21 f.—xp1'›‹reu. χαλκείων and paria
paribus (respondere) are proverbial
expressions; cf. eg. ll. 6. 236;
Plato, Symp. 2. 93 Ter. Phorm-
212. For the alliteration, cf. Intr.
93. The Latin expression occurs
in a fuller form in Plaut. Pers. 223
par pari respondes dicto. This
substantival use of a neuter adj.
in the dat. is very unusual in Latin.
The nearest parallel in Cicero is
parva magnis conferuntur, Orat.
14. Cf. also a quotation from a
letter written by Atticus (Att. 16.
7. 6) unde par pari respondeatur.

23. ecce: used in colloquial lan-
guage to introduce a new subject,
and oftentimes one which causes
surprise, eg. ecce Apollo mi ex ora-
clo imperat, Plaut. Asen. 841 ; ecce
postridie Cassio litterae Capua a
Lucretio, Att. 7. 24. It is there-
fore often accompanied by subito,
repente, de improviso, and the ethi-
cal dative; cf. Intr. 83 c. This
use of ecce is in harmony with its
use in comedy to announce an
unexpected appearance, eg. ecce
autem video rure redeuntem senem,

Ter. Eun. 967. For the phrases

used to indicate a transition where
no surprise is expressed, cf. Intr.
91. — ἀναντιῴὠνητον, without an
answer. There are more than 70

s Greek words in the Letters con-

taining α privative. Their fre-
quency in colloquial language is
due to the fact that they enabled
a writer to avoid a long Latin ex-
pression; cf. Intr. 95:— proposuit,
lzas offered for sale. — Lucceius:
not the historian. This Lucceius
was so heavily in debt (Att. 5. 21.
13) that he proposed to sell his
Tusculan villa—nisi forte, etc.:
see Crit. Append. — tibicine, roos-
tree (lit. pillar supporting roos ) ; cf.
Festus, Ι. 558, ed. de Ponor ; Juv.
3. 193.——Lentulum: his indebt-
edness is mentioned by Caesar
B. C. 1. 4. He was consul in 49
B.C.‚ accompanied Pompey to
Greece, and after the battle of
Pharsalus was put to death by
King Ptolemy in Egypt, cf. Caes.
B. C. 3. 104. 3.—-cupio etiam
Sestium ε sc. expeditum videre. —-
Sestium: see Ep. XVI. 5f.—-sis:
for si vis, as frequently in Latin
comedy and satire. Cf. sultis for
si vultis. — αἴδεσθεν, etc.: from
ll. 7. 93. As the leaders of the
Greeks were afraid to accept and
ashamed to decline the challenge
