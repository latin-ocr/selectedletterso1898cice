CICERO DOLABELLAE CONSVLI SVO S.

Etsi contentus eram, mi Dolabella, tua gloria satis-
que ex ea magnam laetitiam voluptatemque capiebam,
tamen non possum non confiteri cumulari me maximo
gaudiO, quod vulgo hominum opinio socium me adscri-
bat tuis laudibus, Neminem conveni—convenio autem
· cotidie plurimos; sunt enim permulti optimi viri qui
valetudinis causa in haec loca veniant, praeterea ex
municipiis frequentes necessarii meh—(quin omneS,
cum te summis laudibus ad caelum extulerunt, mihi
continuo maximas gratias agant; negant enim se dubi-
tare quin tu meis praeceptis et consiliis obtemperans
praestantissimum te civem et singularem consulem
praebeas, Quibus ego quamquam verissime possum

forth this enthusiastic letter from
Cicero. The extravagant tone of

LXXXVII. Pompeii, May 3,
44 B.C. One of the many dema—
gogues in Rome at this time, Hero-
philus or Amatius by name, who
claimed to be descended from
Gaius Marius, took advantage of

the letter has been condemned by
many, but Cicero’s real purpose
was not so much to compliment
Dolabella for the vigor of his ac-

the excitement to erect an altar to
Caesar in the Forum, on the spot
where Caesar‘s body had been
burned. Although Herophilus was
put to death as an instigator of
riot‚ the altar which he had erected
remained, and a column in Cae-
sar's honor was soon after set up.
Dolabella, Cicero’s former son—in—
law, who was one of the consuls
for 44, during the absence from
Rome of his colleague Antony‚
had the altar and column de-
stroyed, and those concerned in
. the movement put to death (cf.
Att. 14. 15. 1). It was this action
on Dolabella's part which called

tion, although he appreciated that,
as to attach him definitely to the
cause of Brutus and Cassius. This
hope of Cicero was short-lived.
Dolabella's action had been mere-
ly a bid for a bribe from the Cae-
sanans, and when this was forth-
coming, he ceased to pose as a
republican3 cf. Intr. 56.

1. valetudinis causa ε the Bay
of Naples was and still is afavorite
health resort. Cf. ad Baias, Ep. V.
10 n. — necessarii mei: Cicero's
hold upon the munictjia was a
strong one3 cf. concurszeltaliae,
Ep. XV. 4 n. — ad caelum, etc.:
cf. Bibulus in caelo est, Ep. VII. 2.
