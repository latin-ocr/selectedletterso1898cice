134 CICERo’s LETTERS. [Ep. xxxv.

Capitolio posuit animadvertissem in Serapionis sub-
scriptione Africani imaginem, erratum fabrile putavi,
nunc video Metelli. O ἀνιστορησιάν turpem! Nam
illud de Flavio et fastiS‚ si secus est, commune erra-
tum est, et tu belle ἠπόρησας, et nos publicam prope
opinionem secuti sumus, ut multa apud Graecos Quis
enim non dixit Εὔπολιν, τὸν τῆς ἀρχαίας, ab Alcibiade
navigante in Siciliam deiectum esse in mare? Red-
arguit Eratosthenes; adfert enim quas ille post id
tempus fabulas docuerit. Num idcirco Duris SamiUS‚
homo in historia diligens, quod cum multis erravit,
irridetur? Quis Zaleucum leges Locris scripsisse non
dixit? Num igitur iacet TheophrastUS‚ si id a Timaeo
tuo familiari reprehensum est? Sed nescire proavum
suum censorem non fuisse turpe est, praesertim cum
post eum consulem nemo Cornelius illo vivo censor

grown so great that many were
removed to the Campus Martius,
and Caligula forbade any one to
erect a statue to a living man
without his permission; cf. Suet.
Calzg. 34. The rostra was simi-
larly adorned with statues; cf. Cic.
Phil. 9. 16.

18. illud de Flavio et fastis:
in the de li'e Pub. Atticus thought
(cf. 8) that Cicero meant to put
Cn. Flavius, who published the cal-
endar for the benefit of the people
(cf. Livy, 9. 46. 5; Cic. pro Mur.
25), before the time of the decem-
virs. — tu belle ἠπόρησας, you
made a good peina—ut multa
(errata) apud Graecos: Cicero
wishes to show that his country-
men are no more inaccurate with
reference to their history than the
Greeks are in their history. Cicero
prided himself also upon his knowl-
edge of nice points in Greek his-

tory and literature, which the dis-
cussion gives him an opportunity
to air. — Εὔπολιν, τὸν τῆς ἀρχαίας
(κωμῳδίας); Eupolis, of the fifth
century B.C.‚ was a writer of the
old comedy. The story ran that
Alcibiades put him to death for
ridiculing him in a comedy.—
redarguit Eratosthenes: sc. in
his book περὶ Κωμῳδίας. - Zaleu-
cum: as we learn from de Leg. 2.
15, Theophrastus mentions Zaleu-
cus as the law-giver of the Lo-
crians, while Timaeus maintained
that no such man ever lived.—
num . . . Theophrastus, is Theo-
phrastus tlzen not read .? Theo-
phrastus was a disciple of Plato,
and afterwards of Aristotle. —
Timaeo: cf. Ep. XVIII. 7 n.—
nemo Cornelius: Cicero com-
monly uses nemo in preference
to nullus with nouns indicating
persons.
