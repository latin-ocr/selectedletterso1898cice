82 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. XIX.

tribuo quam sapientiae tuae, sin haec, quae ceteri mi-
rantur, contemnenda duxisti et, cum per valetudinem
posses, venire tamen noluisti, utrumque laetor, et sine
dolore corporis te fuisse et animo valuisse, cum ea quae
sine causa mirantur alii neglexeris, modo ut tibi con-
stiterit fructus oti tui, quo quidem tibi perfrui mirifice
licuit, cum esses in ista amoenitate paene solus relictus,
Neque tamen dubito quin tu in illo cubiculo tUO, ex quo
tibi Stabianum perforasti et patefecisti sinum, per eos
dies matutina tempora lectiunculis consumpseriS, cum
illi interea, qui te istic reliquerunt, spectarent communis

Ν. H. 36. 115), was the first per-
manent theatre constructed in
Rome, and its opening was cele-
brated by gorgeous pageants and
by combats between men and wild
beasts, in which, according to
Pliny, 20 elephants and 500 lions
were killed. The distaste which
Cicero shows for the vulgar dis-
play, and the pity which the slaugh-
ter of the unfortunate beasts ex-
cited in him, honorably distinguish
him from his contemporaries.
These particular venationes were so
bloodthirsty that even the Roman
populace was moved to pity when
the elephants, seeing their escape
cut off, seemed to beg for mercy:
amissa fugae spe, misericordiam
vulgi inenarrabili habitu quaeren-
tes supplicavere, quadam sese la-
mentatione complorantes, tonto po-
puli dolore ut oblitus imperatoris
ac munzficentiae lzonori suo exqui-
sitae flens universus consurgeret
dirasque Pompeio poenas impreca-

1. Stabianum . . . sinum: the
Italians of the present day who
have villas on the lakes or sea-
shore, often cut down the trees

Reliquas vero partis diei tu consu-

in front of their houses, that they
may obtain an unobstructed view
across the water; so Marius would
seem to have cut the trees down
in a line through his Stabian es-
tate (lit. ‘he bored through ') to
the shore, and thus brought the
bay into view—lectiunculis, by
reading a bit lzere and a bit tlzere.
mimos: the mimus, which was
introduced into Rome from Taren-
tum in the third century B.C., was
at the outset a character presenta-
tion by dancers, but, in the sec-
ond century probably, dialogue
and songs were introduced. Facial
expression always played an im-
portant part in it, so that the per-
formers did not wear masks. In
Cicero’s time mimi were put on
the stage only as afterpieces (cf.
Ep. LXI. 7). The degraded taste
of imperial times, however, pre-
ferred them to the drama proper,
so that they practically drove the
latter from the stage. Cf. also

period dramatic performances be-
gan early in the day, and those
for whom seats were not reserved
