Pompey¹ and Syria to Crassus ² for five years, and prolong-
ing Caesar's proconsulship for the same period.

Cicero took little part in politics during the years 5 5· and
54 B.C., and his letters exhibit his discouragement in regard
to them.³ They indicate, however, the growth of a cordial
feeling between him and Caesar.4 Much of Cicero's atten-
tion was given to literature. To this period belong the
De Oratore, the De Re chblz'ca,⁵ and several speeches ς
among them, one in defense of Cn. Plancius, who received
Cicero so generously at Thessalonica during the latter's exile.

of bribery and political intrigue,6 which had prevailed almost
uninterruptedly from midsummer of the year 54 B.C.,
reached its climax in Jan., 52 B.C., in a riotous contest
between the followers of Clodius and Milo, which resulted
in the death of the former,⁷ and, as a last resort, Pompey
was elected sole consul on the 24th of the intercalary month
of this year.8 This sudden elevation to extraordinary power
completed the separation of Pompey from Caesar.

Several circumstances which occurred during the previous
two years had paved the way for this result. First of all the
death of Julia, Caesar's daughter and Pompey's wife, in 54
B.C.,⁹ and the subsequent refusal of Pompey to enter into
another family alliance with Caesar, severed a link which
had bound the two men together3 but a still more important
factor was the defeat and death of Crassus in the East'in
53 B.C.¹⁰ The indefinite continuance of a triumvirate was
possible, but the existence of a duumvirate was impossible,
