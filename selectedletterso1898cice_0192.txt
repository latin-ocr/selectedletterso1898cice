110 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. XXX.

veluti Mennianorum praediorum vel Atilianorum. De
Oppio factum est ut volui, et maxime quod DCCC aperu-
isti; quae quidem ego utique vel versura facta solvi
volO‚ ne extrema exactio nostrorum nominum exspecte-
tur. Nunc venio ad transversum illum extremae epistu-
lae tuae versiculum, in quo me admones de sorore.
Quae res se sic habet. Vt veni in Arpinas, cum ad
me frater venisset, in primis nobis sermO, isque multUS,
de te fuit, ex quo ego veni ad ea quae fueramus ego et
tu inter nos de sorore in Tusculano locuti. Nihil tam
vidi mite, nihil tam placatum quam tum meus frater
erat in sororem tuam, ut >etiarn si qua fuerat ex ratione
sumptus offensi0‚ non appareret. Illo sic die; postridie
ex Arpinati profecti sumus, Vt in Arcano Quintus
maneret dies fecit, ego Aquini, sed prandimus in Ar-
cano, Nosti hunc fundum. Quo ut venimUS, huma-
nissime Quintus ‘Pomponia ’ inquit, ‘tu invita muliereS,

estate—or tlte Atz'lz'an (as I had
better call z't).—de Oppio: C.
Oppius, Caesar’s agent in Rome,
belonged to that little group of
young men who followed Caesar's
cause faithfully. His biography of
Caesar probably formed the basis
of Plutarch's sketch.-— quod DCCC
(sc. sestertia) aperuisti, because you
have expressed a readiness to pay
tlze 800,000 sesterces. The meaning
of aperuisti is, however, doubtful.
This debt to Caesar, which was
still outstanding in Dec.‚ 50 B.C.
(Att. 7. 3. 11), was evidently ex-
pected to block Cicero's opposi-
tion to the triumvirs. The plan
accomplished its object; cf. Att.
7. 3. 11 ‘ But you know how much
is still due him. Do you think,
pray, that Ι have reason to fear
lest some Pompeian may twit me

with it, if my opposition to Caesar
is rather half-hearted‚ or lest Cae-
sar may call in the loan, if Ι oppose
him somewhat vigorously? Ι fancy
that, if Ι ever speak boldly in the
senate in behalf of the common-
wealth‚ Ι fancy, Ι say, that your
Tarshish friend Balbus will meet
me at the door and say, ‘⁶ Pray let
me have a cheque for that money.’' '
——vel versura facta, even if a
(new) loun has to be made.
