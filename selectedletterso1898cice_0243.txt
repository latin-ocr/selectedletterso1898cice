multa nocte. — age iam : age
with or without the adverbs iam,
ergo, zgritur, etc., or duplicated
(age, age), is common in colloquial
Latin to give force to a question,
concession, or command; cf. age,
age ιιι* lubet, Ter. And. 310; age, da
veniam filio, Ter. Ad. 937.— cum
fratre : Quintus had been Cae-
sar's legate, and his espousal of
Pompey's cause would seem an
act of ingratitude‚ and bring down
the wrath of Caesar upon both
Quintus and his brother. —illiusz
i.e. Caesaris. —populare : Cicero,
although respected by the Italian
peasantry‚ was thoroughly unpop-
”lar with the democracy of Rome.
Cf. Att. 8. ΙΙ D. 7 ut mea persona
semper ad improborum civium im-
petus aliquid videretur habere popu-
lare—fasces . . . laureatos : in
hopes of a triumph for his mili-
tary successes in Cilicia, he still re-
tained the insignia of an impera-
tor, although the retention of them
exposed him to ridicule. Cf. Att.
7. 10. 1 subito consilium cepi, ut
ante quam luceret exirem, ne qni
conspectus fieret aut sermo, lictori-

bus praesertim laureatis. This pic—
ture of Cicero lends a touch of
comedy to the tragedy of the
Civil War. — ut . . . utamur: a
hortatory clause with a concessive
force. — illurn ι i.e. Pompeium. —
qua : sc. via.

6. in hac parte: i.e. in Italy.
Cicero's reference to a retreat
from Italy on the part of the
Pompeians is in the nature of a
prophecy. In so far as official in-
formation had been given out, a
stand was to be made at Luceria.
Strangely enough, however, only
the day before this letter was
written Pompey had ordered his
forces to collect at Brundisium
with a view to crossing to Dyrra-
chium (cf. Att. 8. 12 A. 3), but
Cicero did not know this.—-in
Cinnae dominatione τ when Ma-
rius and Cinna in 87 B.C. ap-
proached Rome, many of the
Optimates fied, as the same class
of men did on the approach of
Caesar, but Philippus, Flaccus,
and Mucius remained in the city,
and Mucius (Q. Mucius Scae-
vola) was murdered a few years
