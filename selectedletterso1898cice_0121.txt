tatis ἅλις, tamquam δρυόςε saluti, si me arnaS, consule.'
Me miserum! cur non ades? Nihil profecto te praeteri-
ret ; ego fortasse τυφλώττω et nimium τῷ καλῷ προσ--
πέπονθα. - Scito nihil umquam fuisse tam infame, tam 2
turpe, tarn peraeque omnibus generibus ordinibus
aetatibus offensum quam hunc statum qui nunc est;

⁴ my other troubles concern impor-
tant matters.'—dignitatis ἅλις,
tamquam δρυός, quite enoung of
dzgmz'z‘y, as men said qs tlze oak.
The proverbial expression, ἅλις
δρυός, refers to the time when men
gave up adiet of acorns for one of
bread. In general language, ‘times
are changed, and what suited the
past is ill adapted to the present.’
Jeans aptly cites the same proverb
from Voltaire: ‘ Le siecle du gland
est passe', vous donnerez du pain
aux hommes? Cf. also Intr.
102. — τυῴλώττω and τῷ καλῷ
προσ-πέπονθα (am passionately at-
tached) are very likely naturalized
Greek phrases. Cf. Intr. 97.

2. generibus, ordinibus, to
all parties, classes.—non modo
quam putaram: ‘to say nothing
of what I had anticipated.’ ——
populares : the triumvirs‚ who
found their supporters in the

democratic party.— Bibulus: Cae-
sar's colleague in the consulship;
cf. Lucceium, Ep. VI. 11 n. He
opposed Caesar's plans to the
best of his ability, but his oppo-
sition was rather obstinate than
effective. Cf. Mommsen, Rom.
Hist. IV. 245. Subsequently he
was commander of Pompey’s fleet
in the Civil War.— in caelo est,
is extolled to tlze skies. —unus
homo, etc.: the celebrated line
from the Annals of Ennius de-
scriptive of Fabius Maximus C unc-
tator, ironically applied to the pas-
sive resistance of Bibulus. -ipse
se adflixit: i.e. by allying himself
with Caesar. ——tenent: sc. the tri-
umvirs. —illa causa: the cause of
the triumvi1·s.— illam amicitiam:
Cicero's well-known friendship for
Pompey.—utor via: i.e. the via
media, turning off neither to the
one side nor to the other.
