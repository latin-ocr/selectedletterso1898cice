lxxiv INTRODUCTION.

characteristics of colloquial language is its fondness for the
picturesque. This is secured mainly by the use of meta-
phors. One of the commonest figures employed in the
Letters is that drawn from heat and cold,-—the former
indicating activity, the latter inertia: eg. illi rumores de
comitiis Transpadanorum Cumarum tenus caluerunt (Cael.,
Fam. 8. 1. 2); cum Romae a iudiciis sorum refrixerit (A tt.
1. 1. 2); scripsi Curionem valde frigere, iam calet (Cael.,
Fam. 8. 6. 5). Commercial, legal, and popular expressions,
in a figurative sense, also occur in great variety. Cf. also
notes to quas ego pugnas et quantas strages edidi, Epist. V. 1,
and medicinam, Epist. IX. 2.

100. Polite Plerases. Such polite phrases as si me amas
(eg. Vatin., Fam, 5. 9. 1), amabe te (eg. Cael., Fam. 8. 6. 5),
and such terms of endearment as mel ac deliciae tuae (Cael.,
Fam. 8. 8. 1), are naturally of frequent occurrence. Appar-
ently the Plautine sis (si vis) and sodes are not used. Cf.
also notes to nostri amores, Epist. VII. 2, si me amas, Epist.
XIII. 3, and molestum, Epist. XVIII. 10.

101. Pleonasm. While aiming at brevity in some caseS‚
in others familiar speech indulges itself in duplicative or
pleonastic expressions for the sake of emphasis or distinct-
ness, in much the same way as it employs extravagant
language. Instances from the Letters are rursus reducere
(Balbus, Att. 8. 15a. 1) 3 malle potius (Cato, Fam. 15. 5. 2);
nostro iudicio . . . existimamus (Balbus and Oppius, Att.
9. 7a. 1), Ostentare crebre (Dolabella, Fam 9. 9. 2). On
‘double expressions,’ cf. note to 0r0 obsecro, Epist. L. 1.

102. l'opular and l’roverbial Expressions. The informal
character of the Letters is shown, not so much by the fre-
quent use of these expressions, although their number in
the aggregate is large, as by the fact that they are unac-
cornpanied by any such apologetic phrase as ut aiunt,
