CICERO’S LETTERS.

⁸ Att. 13. 52.] 245

Ἐμετικὴν agebat; itaque et edit et
bibit ἀδεῶς et iucunde, opipare sane et apparate, nec ,

id solum, sed bene cocto

Condito, sermone bono et, si quaeri’, libenter.

Praeterea tribus tricliniis accepti οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν valde
copiose; libertis minus lautis servisque nihil defuit:
nam lautiores eleganter accepti. Quid multa? homines

visi sumus, Hospes tamen non is cui diceres: ‘Amabo

te, eodem ad me, cum revertere.’

the death of Mamurra, but prob-
ably, as Manutius suggests, Cicero
has in mind his conviction under
the sumptuary laws3 cf. also Riese
on Catull. Car. 29.— mutavit:
,used absolutely as in Fam. 16. 1.
1.——-accubuit: Caesar followed
the regular order, viz„ exercise, the
bath, ᾱίηηεΥ.-ἑμετικὴν agebat
(sc. τέχνην), lte was taking a course
ofemetics. Emetics were regularly
prescribed by physicians in order
that patients might escape the
effects resulting from eating
elaborate dinners. They were
taken in the morning, after the
bath or after the cena. The use of
them was, however, by no means
confined to men of a gluttonous
disposition ; cf. pro Deiot. 21,
where the speaker certainly has
every reason to avoid offending
Caesar: cum . . . vomere post
cenam te velle dixisses. See also
Marq. and Momm. Handbu'clz, VII.
330, and n. 5 and 6. For the
Greek word, cf. Intr. 97.—- opi-
pare : from the colloquial vocab-
ulary. Cf. Plaut. Bacch. 37 33
Caecil. Stat. 100, Ribbeck, Com.
Rom. Frag. It occurs also Att. 5.
9.1;7.2.3; andde Off3. 58 in a
quotation. —sane ,· cf. Ep. XVI.

- 2 n.—apparate: used only in
the Letters (Hofmann). —bene ,

Semel satis est.

cocto condito: sc. cibo. The
quotation, which is from Lucilius,
is found also de Fin. 2. 25: ex quo
illud efficitur, qm· bene cenent, om-
nes libenter cenare, qni libenter,
non continno bene. Semper Lae-
lius bene. Quid bene ,9 Dicet Lu-
cilius: ‘cocto Ι condito’ ,· sed cedo
caput cenae: ‘sermone banoy quid
ex eo? ‘si qnaeri', libenter.'- si
quaeri': for si quaeris. — libenter:
to be connected with some form
of cenare in the unquo'ted part of
the original.

2. tribus tricliniis : in uno
liberti lautiores, in altero minus
lauti, in tertio discubuere servi
(Manutius). —nam‚ etc.: the rea-
son for Cicero's use of the words
minus lautis—quid multa, in
a word‚· cf. qm'a' quaeris, Ep. V.
4n. These words indicate that
what follows conveys Cicero's
general impression of the whole
affair. — homines, ordinary mor-
tals (not Caesar the dictator, and
Cicero the constitutionalist). Cf.
Ep. XX. 3 virum te putabo, si
Sallusti Empedoclea legeris, leomi-
nem non putabo. The dinner was
such a dinner as one gentleman
might give to another.—amabo
te: see Intr. 1003 Archiv f. lat.
Lexikog. IX. 485 ff.; and cf. si
me amas, Ep. XIII. 3 n. —ad me:
