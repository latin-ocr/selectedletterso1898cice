lxxii INTRODUCTION.

II. PHRASEOLOGY.

93. Alliteration. While alliteration is found in the prose
and poetry of all periods‚ it is especially common in ancient
legal and religious formulae and in popular sayings. As
the latter appear in large numbers in the more familiar
letters, alliteration becomes one of the stylistic character-
istics of Cicero's correspondence. Cf. cara, cogitatio, . . .
commentatio causarum (Fam. 9. 20. Ι) ; opera et oleam (Att.
2. 17. 1).

94. Asyndez‘on. In addition to asyndeton for emphasis
and between clauses in lively narration, which is found
in contemporaneous formal literature, Bockel ² calls attention
to two classes of cases in which asyndeton occurs in the
Letters, as it does in other colloquial literature, with great
frequency: (1) between two expressions of opposite mean-
ing, e.g. palam secrete (Cael, Fam. 8. 1. 4), velit nolit (Q.
sr. 3. 8. 4) 3 (2) between two expressions of similar meaning,
e.g. intercedendi impediendi (Fam. 8. 8. 6), certa clara (All. 16.
130. 2). Many of these expressions, like those discussed
under Alliteratien, are stereotyped popular phrases.

95. Brevity. Brevity is secured in many cases by the use
of pregnant expressions, and by the omission of words and
phrases not absolutely necessary to the sense. The words
most commonly omitted are esse, dicere (many forms of both
words are omitted), fieri, aedes, and the pronoun as an
object or as the subject of an infinitive.

In some instances more uncommon ellipses occur, e.g.
ex Gallia [provincia] Lepidi (Pollio, Fam. 10. 33. 4); lzoc
magis animadversam est, quod intactus ab sibilo pervenerat
Hortensius ad senectutem ,· sed tam tam bene (sibilatas est) ut
in lotam vitam quoiw's satis esset (Cael, Fam. 8. 2. 1). Cf.
also ἓ 75, and note to a Vestae, Epist. XIII. 2.

1 Aa. 8. 3. 3.
