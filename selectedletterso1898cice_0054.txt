him recoil fr'om the materialism of the one' and the coldness
of the other. He became, therefore, an eclectic.

CICERO’S FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

TERENTIA AND PUBL1L1A.

52. Α fair knowledge of the relations existing between
Cicero and his wife Terentia may be gained from the letters
of Bk. 14, ad Fam„ all of which are addressed to her. In
the early letters of this correspondence written in 58 B.c.‚
after twenty years of married life, Cicero expresses himself
in most affectionate terms. After this date, with the excep-
tion of one letter in 50 ss.c., which is mainly upon business
matters, there are no letters to Terentia up to 49 B.c.,
although this interval includes the period of his procon-
sulship, when he wrote so many letters to his persona] and
political friends. Even the letters of the year 49, when
Cicero was in so much anxiety, are very infrequent. The
rest of the letters of Bk. 14, belonging to the next two
years, are brief and formal. It appears that an estrange·
ment gradually grew up between them which culminated
in their divorce in the early part of 46 B.c. In December
of the same year he married his rich ward Publilia13 but
Publilia could not conceal her chagrin at finding herself
second to Tullia in his affection, and when she evinced
joy a few months later at Tullia's death, Cicero sent her to
her mother and could not be induced to receive her back

into his favor.²
