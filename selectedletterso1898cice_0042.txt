46 Β.(ῑ.1 Although he attended the meetings of the senate,
he took little active part in politics, save in working to secure
the recall of some Pompeians who were still in exile. At one
time Cicero hoped that Caesar would follow a conservative
’ course and would at least restore the senate to its old posi-
tion and influence, and it was with this hope in his mind
that he spoke so warmly of him in his oration pro Marcello,-
but he soon saw clearly that it was Caesar’s purpose to
retain the supreme power in his own hands, especially when,
at the close of the year 46, Caesar, on departing for Spain,
left the city in charge of eight praefecti, who were directly
responsible to his personal representatives, Cornelius Balbus
and C. Oppius.2

rallied under the leadership of Labienus and the two sons
of Pompey, at Munda,3 Mar. 17, 45 B.c., and returned to
Rome in September to continue the reforms which he had
already begun, and to make preparations for his great cam-
paign against the Parthians in the following year. In the
meantime a conspiracy was forming against him, led by a
few disappointed office-seekers and fanatics, and fostered
by the traditional Roman prejudice against the title of rex
and the regal insignia. The indiscreet act of Antony and
of some other persona] friend (or enemy ?), in offering a
diadem to Caesar,4 and in crowning his statue with a laurel
wreath‚5 strengthened the conspiracy, while Caesar's own
course in openly assuming supreme power, a course far
removed from the more diplomatic poli'cy of his successor
Augustus, must have offended the more conservative element.
The meeting of the senate on Mar. 15, 44 13.c., furnished a
suitable occasion, the presentation of a petition by L. Tillius
