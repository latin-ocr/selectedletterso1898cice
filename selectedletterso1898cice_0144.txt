cursu Italiae legem comitiis centuriatis esse perlatam.
Inde a Brundisinis honestissimis ornatus iter ita feci
ut undique ad me cum gratulatione legati convenerint.
5 Ad urbem ita veni ut nemo ullius ordinis homo nomen-
clatori notus fuerit qui mihi obviam non venerit, praeter
eos inimicos quibus id ipsum, se inimicos esse, non
liceret aut dissimulare aut negare. Cum venissem ad
portam Capenam, gradus templorum ab infimo plebe
completi erant, a qua plausu maximo cum esset mihi
gratulatio significata, similis et frequentia et plausus
me usque ad Capitolium celebravit, in foroque et in
ipso Capitolio miranda multitudo fuit. Postridie in
senatU, qui fuit dies Nonarum Septembr., senatui gra-

5. nomenclatori: the nomen-
clator stood at his master’s elbow,

the city through the porta Capena,
at the right of which was the tem-
ple of Honos and Virtus.—ab

lian, thence through the Forum,
and up the Clivus to the Capitol.
—senatui gratias egimus: in
the Oratio post Rediturm though
the authenticity of the extant ora-

6. ad theatrum: to the tem-
