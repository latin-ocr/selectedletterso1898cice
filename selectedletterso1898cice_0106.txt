24 CICERo‘s LETTERS. [Ep. v.

sed carceri reservarunt, neque te retinere in civitate,
sed exsilio privare voluerunt. Quam ob rem, patres
conscripti, erigite animos, retinete vestram dignitatem.
Manet illa in re publica bonorum consensi03 dolor

inclusi.

wild beasts. Catiline is compared
to a wolf, Cic. in Cat. 2. 2. — re-
servarunt: Cicero addressed Cat-
iline in 64 13.c. in almost the same
language: 0 miser, qui non sen-
tias illo iudicio te non absolutum,
verum ad aliquod- severius iudi-
cium ac maius supplicium reserva-
tum (Or. in tog. caud). -- exsilio
privare: if Clodius had been con-
victed, he would have been exiled.
The iudices, by acquitting him,
have deprived him of the safety
which exile would give, and al-
lowed him an open field in which
to commit a crime punishable with
death, the carcer being the com-
mon place of execution for citi-
zens. The oration of which this
was a part was entitled‚ Oratio in
P. Clodium et C. Curionem, and
has been preserved in a frag-
mentary form.—illa . . . con-
sensio: ‘that harmony which my
consulship secured.' Cf. note on
6.——quod erat, inventurn est:
the jurors who acquitted Clodius
were venal before; the trial had
merely brought that fact to light.

10. pulchellus: diminutive of
pulcher, a parody upon Clodius's
cognomen Pulcher, while at the
same time it contains an ironical
allusion to his lack of personal

beauty, to which Cicero refers,
Or. iu P. Clod. ct C. Cur. .· sed

Sed quid ago? paene orationem in epistulam
Redeo ad altercationem. Surgit pulchellus

credo postquam speculum tibi ad-
latum est longe te a pulchris
abesse sensisti. Pulchellus may
also be used in derision of the
effeminacy of Clodius, for, speak-
ing of the group of young men
to whom Clodius belonged, Cic-
ero says, concursabant barbatuli
iuvenes, totus ille grex Catilinae,
Att. 1. 14. 5. Well-trimmed beards
marked the climax of dandyism.
Diminutives do not always indi-
cate that the individual in ques-
tion is smaller than others of its
kind, but that the speaker feels
affection, pity, or contempt for
it. Thus Cicero speaks of his
daughter as Tulliola (my darling
Tullia), Att. 4. 1. 43 Servius, re-
ferring to the sad death of the
same woman, speaks of her as a
muliercula, Fam. 4. 5. 43 while
the predominant feeling suggested
by pulchellus is one of contempt.
Such a use of the diminutive is
especially common in colloquial
language. Diminutive adjectives
and adverbs with this force are
farther removed from formal lan-
guage than diminutive nouns, and
the very fact that these adjectives
and adverbs are not infrequent in
Cicero’s letters is one of the
strongest indications of the fa-
miliar character of the letters. Cf.
misellus (Att. 3. 23. 5), vetulus
