Fam. 7. 5-] CICERo‘s LETTERs. 89

quae ad meos pertinent. C. Trebatium cogitaram, quo-
cumque exirem, mecum ducere, ut eum meis omnibus
studiis beneficiis quam ornatissimum domum reducerem;
sed postea quam et Pompei commoratio diuturnior erat
quam putaram, et mea quaedam tibi non ignota dubi-
tatio aut impedire profectionem meam videbatur aut
certe tardare, (vide quid mihi sumpserim l) coepi velle
ea Trebatium exspectare a te quae sperasset a me,
neque mercule minus ei prolixe de tua voluntate pro-
Casus vero
mirificus quidam intervenit, quasi vel testis opinionis
meae vel sponsor humanitatis tuae. Nam cum de hoc
ipso Trebatio cum Balbo nostro loquerer accuratius

misi quam eram solitus de mea polliceri.

tus. Horace introduces him as
a speaker in Sat. 2. 1.

1. me alterum: cf. Ep. XV. 7 n.
—quocurnque exirem : Pompey
had named Cicero as one of his
. 15 legati on the corn commission
in 57 B.c. (Ep. XV. 7), and Cicero
would naturally have gone to some
province in connection with that
matter, but as he preferred to stay
at Rome, his place was taken by
Quintus, who went to Sardinia
(Ep. XVI. 7); or perhaps refer-
ence is made to the fact that the
province of Spain was assigned to
Pompey at the close of his consul-
ship in 55 Bc, and Cicero may
have been invited to accompany
him as his legatus, but, as we
know, Pompey remained at Rome.
-dubitatioz Cicero's hesitation
to leave Rome was due perhaps
partly to a fear that Clodius might
attack him during his absence, and
partly to a fondness for Rome. Cf.
si potes, etc.‚ Ep. XVII. 2 n. — ex-
spectare . . . sperasset: in the
contrast between these two words
lies a delicate compliment to Cae-

sar. The favor of the successful
governor of the Gauls would in-
sure to Trebatius what the friend-
ship of a legatus to Spain could

only make probable.——prolixe: κ

not infrequently in the Letters with
verbs of hoping, thinking, and
promising, adverbs are used in-
stead of the neut. acc. plur. of the
adj. used substantively, eg. ut {pse
facile animadverterem male (for
mala) eum de me cogitare, Fam. 8,
12. 1; non licuit diutius bene de eo
sperare, Fam. 10. 21. 13 si humani-
ter et sapienter et amabiliter in
me cogitare vis, Aa. 14. 13 A. 2.
This is a colloquial usage. — pro-
misi: used οἱ a formal agree-
ment, while polliceri implies a
voluntary promise.

2. Balbo: L. Cornelius Balbus,
a native of Gades, who had re—
ceived Roman citizenship for his
services against Sertorius ; cf. Cic.
pro Balbo, 5 f. He attached him-
self closely to Caesar, and was
often Caesar’s confidential agent
in Rome. We have three of his
letters to Cicero, Att. 9. 7 Α, 7 Β,
