Att. 1. 16.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 23

παρρησίαν eripui, Pisonem consulem nulla in re con-
sistere umquam sum passm, desponsam homini iam
Syriam ademi, senatum ad pristinam suam severitatem
revocavi atque abiectum excitavi, Clodium praesentem
fregi in senatu cum oratione perpetua plenissima gra-
vitatis, tum altercatione huiusmodi, ex qua licet pauca
degustes —— nam cetera non possunt habere neque vim
neque venustatem remoto illo studio contentioniS, quem
c’z‘ycbva vos appellatis, Nam, ut Idibus Maiis in sena-
tum convenimUS, rogatus ego sententiam multa dixi de
summa re publica, atque ille locus inductus a me est
divinitus, ne una plaga accepta patres conscripti conci-
derent, ne deficerent3 vulnus esse eiusmodi, quod mihi
nec dissimulandum nec pertimescendum videretur, ne
aut ignorando stultissimi aut metuendo ignavissimi
iudicaremur. Bis absolutum esse Lentulum, bis Catili-
nam: hunc tertium iam esse a iudicibus in rem publi-

cam immissum. ‘ErraS, Clodi: non te iudices urbi,

with us, egr. (Att. 12. 45. 2) ἀκηδία,
‘emlzct',’ (Act. 7. Ι. 5) ὀδοῦ πάρεργον,
‘en pasl-ant) Cf. Intr. 97. — con-
sistere, to get a footing. — de-
sponsam (not decretam): tle.
promised to Piso by Pompey,
who had just organized Syria
into a province, but not officially
assigned to him by the senate.
-vos, you Atlzenz'ans. Cf. tui
cives, 4.

9. Idibus Maiis: this fixes the
date of the letter as later than
May 15. — rogatus sententiam:
the technical expression used of
the action of the presiding consul
in asking senators their views on
the question before the senate.
The rules of the Roman senate
allowed a senator to depart from
the special topic under considera-
tion, and de summa republica dicere.

Cf. Willems, ΙΙ. 186.—i11e lo-
cus, etc.‚ tlte following point was
developed by me witlz telling ffel.
-Lentulum: Catiline's fellow-
conspirator, who was accused de
peculatu in 80 B.C.‚ and at a later
date underwent a similar experi-
ence.— Catilinam: tried on a
charge of ‘repetundae’ in 65 B.C.
(cf. intr. to Ep. ΙΙ.). He was
again on trial, in 64 B.C., for
the murder of M. Marius Gra-
tidianus. No mention is made
here of the charge of incest
brought in 73 B.C. against the
Vestal Fabia, sister of Cicero‘s
wife Terentia, in which Catiline
was implicated. Cicero regarded
the charge as unfounded, and
wished, furthermore, to spare the
good name of Terentia's family.
