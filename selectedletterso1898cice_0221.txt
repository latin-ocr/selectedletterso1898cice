CICERO'S LETTERS. 139

Att. 6. 1.]

Pompei tamen familiari, audivi. Hic Vedius venit mihi
obviam cum duobus essedis et raeda equis iuncta et
lectica et familia magna, pro qua, si Curio legem pertu-
lerit, HS. centenos pendat necesse est. Erat praeterea
cynocephalus in essedo nec deerant onagri. Numquam
vidi hominem nequiorem. Sed extremum audi. De-
versatus est Laodiceae apud Pompeium Vindullum; ibi
sua deposuit, cum ad me profectus est. Moritur inter-
im Vindullus. Quod res ad Magnum Pompeium
pertinere putabatur, C. Vennonius domum Vindulli
venit; cum omnia obsignaret‚ in Vedianas res inci-
dit. In his inventae sunt quinque imagunculae ma-
tronarum, in quibus una sororis amici tui, hominis
‘bruti,’ qui hoc utatur, et uxoris illius ‘lepidi‚' qui

caused slaves who had offended
him to be thrown to the lampreys
in his fish-pond. His name be-
came, like that of Lucullus, a
synonym for extravagance3 cf.
Tac. Ann. 1. 10. —— nebulone : a
word of contempt for a worthless
fellow. In general in colloquial
Latin personal nouns in ο carry
with them a contemptuous force,
and indicate one who is proficient
in a questionable accomplishment;
thus erro (a tramp), Hor. Sat. 2.
7. 113; popino (a glutton), Sat. 2.
7. 39, etc.; and in the Letters‚
combibe (a crouy), Fam. 9. 2 5. 23
salaco (α braggart), Ep. LXXXI.
2; verbero (a rascal), Att. 14. 6. 13
baro (a blocklzead)‚ 5. 1 1.6. Cf. also
R. Fisch, in Arelas. lat. Lex. V.
56-89, and W. Meyer, ibid. 223—2 34.
—cum duobus essedis: the use
of the essedum by people in pri-
vate life was a mark of extreme
affectation. Even in the case of
an official it was very repugnant
to Roman taste. Cf. Cicero's ac-
count of Antony’s official prog-

ress: vehebatur in essedo tribunus
plebis,· lictores la urealiantecedeba nt,
etc., Phil. 2. 58. -— raeda: a light
four-wheeled travelling wagon, such
as Horace used during one stage
of his journey to Brundisium;
cf. Sat. 1. 5. 86.—legem: refer-
ence is made to some sumptuary
law, the provisions of which we
do not know, imposing a tax either
upon familiae or the equipages
of travellers. The cynocephalus
and onagri had no other value
than that they were rare and there-
fore expensive. — ad Magnum
Pompeium: the cognomen, which
is the distinguishing part of this
name, when compared with Pom-
peium Vindullum, is put first
for the sake of emphasis. Vindul-
lus had died intestate and with-
out an heir, so that his property
seemed likely to come to his patron
Pompey. — in his, etc.; as Vedius
was a noted rake, the incident oc-
casioned much gossip, but, strange
to say, Brutus kept up his friendly
relations with Vedius (qui hoc
