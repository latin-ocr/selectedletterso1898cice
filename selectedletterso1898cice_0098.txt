16 ’ · 'CICERO’S LETTERS.

[Ep. V.

strages edidi! quos impetus in Pisonem, in Curionem,
in totam illam manum feci! quo modo sum insectatus
levitatem senum, libidinem iuventutis! “ Saepe, ita me
di iuvent, te non solum auctorem consiliorum meo-
rum, verum etiam spectatorem pugnarum mirificarum

desideravi.

Postea vero quam Hortensius excogitavit

ut legem de religione Fufius tribunus pl. ferret, in qua
nihil aliud a consulari rogatione differebat nisi iudicum
genus —in eo autem erant omnia — pugnavitque ut
ita fieret, quod et sibi et aliis persuaserat nullis illum

221-227. With such a warlike
people as the Romans were, such
metaphors were very natural and
effective in the language of every-
day life. The use of them here
harmonizes with the colloquial
tone of the entire letter3 cf. also
Intr. 99. -— Pisonem: though
consul, and ordered by the senate
to further the passage of the law
by the comitia, Piso was really
acting in the interests of Clodius.
Cf. note to senatus auctoritas
above. — Curionem: father of the
Curio who, as tribune in 50 B.C.,
defended Caesar so brilliantly in
the senate. He led the opposition
in the senate to the bill of investi-
gation (Att. 1. 14. 5).—senum:
Piso and the elder Curio. —— iu-
ventutis : the younger Curio and
young men like him.

2. Hortensius: consu] in 69 13.c..
and the most prominent leader of
the Optimates at this time. He
had been the leading orator in
Rome until Cicero appeared; cf.
Brut. 1. 1.—de religione: con-
cerning the sacrilege which had
been committed. —— legem ferret:
a technical expression, used of
brz'ngingforward α bill. A rogatio
was a bill submitted to the people
for confirmation in the comitia,

for which the people were asked to
vote, and affirmative ballots were
marked V · R (uti rogas). The
rogatio was in this case to be sub-
mitted by a consul (rogatio con-
sularis) in accordance with the
resolution of the senate quoted
above. Cf. note to senatus aucto-
ritas.—iudicum genus: by the
action of the senate, which was
submitted to the people for confir-
mation, a special tribunal would
have been established for the trial
of Clodius, in which the presiding
praetor would have chosen the
iudices. Through the treachery of
Piso and the use of force by Clodius
this bill was not passed in the comi-
tia (Att. 1. 14. 5). About the middle
of February, Fufius, acting in the
interests of Clodius, and carrying
out a compromise accepted by
Hortensius, allowed the passage
by the comitia of a bill which pro-
vided for a court of inquiry, but
left the iudices to be chosen as
usual by lot, since the friends of
Clodius thought that in this way
a venal jury could be secured more
easily, as the defense would have
the right under this arrangement
to reject a certain number of ju-
rors. —— nullis iudicibus: the nega-
tion belongs logically with posse.
