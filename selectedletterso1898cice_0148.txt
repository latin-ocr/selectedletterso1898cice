66 CICERO‘S LETTERS. [Ep. XVI.

mitto. Q. fratrem insigni pietate, virtute, fide praedi-
tum sic amo ut debeo, Te exspecto et oro ut matures
venire, eoque animo venias ut me tuo consilio egere
non sinas. Alterius vitae quoddam initium ordimur.
Iam quidam, qui nos absentes defenderunt, incipiunt
praesentibus occulte irasci, aperte invidere; vehementer

whose sympathy, shown while he
was in misfortune‚ had now given
way to the same jealousy which
they had evinced towards him in
former years. Cf. voluntates nobi-

Pompey to meet Caesar at Luca
in April and renew the Triumvir-

jealousy of Caesar and his open en-
mity towards Crassus; cf. Momm.

but the friends of Pompey con-

followed, cf. Fam. 1. 1. Cicero
espoused the cause of Lentulus.
He uses simply res in referring to
