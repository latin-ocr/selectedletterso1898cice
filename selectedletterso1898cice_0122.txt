40 CICERO’S LETTERS. [Ep. VII.

sensus maxime theatro et spectaculis perspectus est.
Nam gladiatoribus qua dominus qua advocati sibilis
. conscissi; ludis Apollinaribus Diphilus tragoedus in
nostrum Pompeium petulanter invectus est;

Nostra miseria tu es magnus . . .
miliens coactus est dicere;

Eandem virtutem istam veniet tempus cum graviter gemes

totius theatri clamore dixit, itemque cetera—nam et
eiusmodi sunt ii versus ut in tempus ab inimico Pom-
pei scripti esse videantur —- ;

Si neque leges te neque mores [cogunt] . . .

et cetera magno cum fremitu et clamore sunt dicta.
Caesar cum venisset, mortuo plausu Curio filius est
Huic ita plausum est ut salva re publica
Tulit Caesar graviter. Litte-

insecutus
Pompeio plaudi solebat.

of this very prowess of yours‚' i.e.
in carrying everything through
with a high hand. -— mortuo plau-
Su, as tlze applause (for Caesar)
died away. The contrast revealed
Caesar’s unpopularity. Allow-
ance should be made for the fact
that Cicero was sitting among the

of time. Cf. gladiatoribus, Ep.
V. 11 n. and Intr. 83 d. Upon
political demonstrations on such
occasions, Bo'ckel cites pro Sestio,
115-126.— qua . . . qua=et . . .-
et: a usage not occurring in Cic-
ero outside the letters, but found

in comedy; cf. Plaut. Men. 666.—
dominus: this seems from the
connection to refer to Pompey.
As Tyrrell remarks, to the Roman
at this time the figure in the fore-
ground was Pompey, not Caesar.
Pompey attended the gladiatorial
show which was given by Gabinius
(Att. 2. 24. 3).—ludis Apollina-
ribus: given July 6-13, under the
direction of the praetor urbanus.
—istam: difficult to understand
as referring to the subject of ge-
mes; but perhaps we may under-
stand, ‘the time shall corne when
you (Pompey) shall bitterly repent

senators and knights, who favored
Curio, and at a distance from
the lower classes, who were in the
rear of the theatre‚ and could not
well compare the applause from
the two sections, even if he were
impartial. — Curio filius: the
younger Curio continued to be
Caesar's most active and danger-
ous opponent until 50 B.C.‚ when
Caesar purchased his support by
the payment of a large sum of
money. Cf. Fam. 2. 13 2. 7;8.10.
