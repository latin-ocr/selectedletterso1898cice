2 CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. Ι.

hoc percrebrescit, plurimos nostros amicos inveniri.
Nos autem initium prensandi facere cogitaramus eo
ipso tempore quo tuum puerum cum his litteris profi-
cisci Cincius dicebat, in campo comitiis tribuniciis
a. d. XVI Kalend. Sextiles, CompetitoreS, qui certi
esse videantur, Galba et Antonius et Q. Cornificius —-
puto te in hoc aut risisse aut ingemuisse3 ut frontem
feriaS‚ sunt qui etiam Caesonium putent. Aquilium
non arbitramur, qui denegat et iuravit morbum et illud

⁷ suum regnum iudiciale opposuit3 Catilina, si iudicatum ”

erit meridie non lucere, certus erit competitor; de
Aufidio et de Palicano non puto te exspectare dum

will not take place before July‚ 64
B.C. -— cogitaramus and dicebat:
epistolary tenses, representing re7
spectively the perfect and present ;
. cf. Intr.84 c. The statement is put
in the form in which the facts would
present themselves to Atticus when
the letter should be received.—
puerum, servant; referring to the
tabellarius (see Intr. 64).'—Cin-
cius: one of the agents (procura-
tores) of Atticus.—‚a.d. xvi Ka-
lend. Sextiles: this was not the
formal announcement (professio)
on Cicero's part of his intention
of standing fo: the consulship, as
the latter would be made on the
day on which notice of the election
was given, i.e. three nunainae, or
17 days, before the day of the
election. Cf. Herzog, I. p. 656,
1092, n. 2.—Antonius: Cicero’s
colleague in 63 ss.c.—Q. Corni-
ficius: the father of the orator
and politician Q. Cornificius, to
whom Fam. 12. 17—30 are ad·
dressed—risisse aut ingemu-
isse: on hearing that such no-
bodies aspire to the consulship.
The situation, while humorous, is
also one to excite the indignation

,θ

of a patriot. —frontem ferias: cf.
Brut. 278 nulla perturbatio ani·
mi, nulla corporis, frons non per-
cussa, non femur. Cicero speaks
of Caesonius in a very different
way in Verr. i. 29 homo in rebus
iudicandis spectatus et cognitus. —
Aquilium: sc. competitorem sore.
C. Aquilius Gallus was praetor with
Cicero in 66 B.C.—iuravit mor-
bum: the simple acc. after iurare
is rare. The phrase is probably a
legal one; cf. Fam. 8. 8. 3 cum
calumniam iurasset. lurare mor-
bum means ‘to take an oath that
one is ill ' as an excuse for the non—
performance of some duty. — reg-
num iudiciale: Aquilius was a
well-known jurist (pro Caec. 77),
too much occupied with legal

business to engage in politics. Cf. 1

regno forensi, Ep. LXII. 1.—-iu-
dicatum erit: in the approaching
trial of Catiline for misappropria-
tion of public funds. The accuser
was Cicero’s Subsequent enemy
Clodius.— Aufidio: a former prae-
tor in Asia (cf. pro Flacco, 45).—
Palicano: a tribune in 71 Rc.
Cicero’s actual opponents at the
polls were Galba and Catiline, patri-
