CICERO'S LETTERS. 7

venirem, curn is omnia sua studia et officia in me con-
tulisset; quod si voles in me esse durior, ambitionem
putabis mihi obstitisse; ego autem arbitror, etiamsi id
Sit, mihi ignoscendum esse, ἐπεὶ οὐχ ἱερήϊον οὐδὲ βοείην ;
vides enim in quo cursu simus et quam omnes gratias
non modo retinendaS, verum etiam acquirendas pute-

mus
certe.

Spero tibi me causam probasse, cupio quidem
Hermathena tua valde me delectat et posita ‘

ita belle est ut totum gymnasium eius ἀνάθημα 6556

videatur.

Multum te amamus,

CICERO ATTICO SAL.

L. Iulio Caesare C. Marcio Figulo consulibus filiolo

samia (Tyrrell). ——- ἐπεὶ οὔχ ἱερήϊον
, οῡδῖβοείηω ll. XXII. 159. The
meaning js ‘since it is no small
prize I fight for.'

5. Hermathena: a double-
faced statue or bust, similar to
those found in excavations to·day.
One face was that of Hermes, the
other that of Athena.— ut totum
gymnasium . . . videatur: this
is the MS. reading, but is scarcely
intelligible; perhaps it means, ‘so
that the whole gymnasium seems
to be an offering to it ' (VVatson).
—multum te amamus: a collo-
quial expression of gratitude.

ΙΙ. Rome, the latter part of 65
B.c. The historical value of this
letter springs from the fact that it
fixes the date of the birth of Cice-
ro’s son (65 136), that it contains
the main point in the evidence with
reference to Cicero's defense of
Catiline against the charge of mis-
appropriation of public money, and
accounts for the absence of letters
between Cicero and Atticus from

64-62 BC. inclusive (cf. last sen-
tence).

1. L. Iulio Caesare C. Marcio
Figulo consulibus: the natural
meaning would be, ‘in the con-
sulship of,’ etc„ and would make
64 B.C. the date of this letter, but
the reference to the approaching
trial of Catiline proves that it
must have been written in 65 13.c.,
after the election of the new con-
suls, as the trial was-begun and fin-
ished in that year. The brevity and
apparent lack of feeling in Cicero's
announcement to his most inti-
mate friend of the birth of his
son has called forth severe criti-
cisms from his enemies, and apolo-
gies from his friends (cf. Abeken,
pp. 33, 34) - quite without reason.
Both parties have failed to see the
gay humor of the passage which
couples this important event in his
family life with the most important
event in the politica] world. For
an account of the new consuls, cf.
Ep. I.— filiolo: for an account
