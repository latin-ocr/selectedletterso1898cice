Ex litteris tuiS, quas publice mi· 1

sisti, cepi una cum omnibus incredibilem voluptatem;
tantam enim spem oti ostendisti quantam ego semper

omnibus te uno fretus pollicebar.

suspicor tibi, nisi si qui admodum
te amant, invidere. Hortensius
and Crassus may have been par-
ticularly in Cicero's thoughts. Be-
sides the feeling of distrust which
certain members of the aristocracy
cherished toward this novus lto-
mo, many of them were offended
by his previous democratic ten-
dencies as shown, for instance, in
the prosecution of Verres, and by
his willingness to rob the oligarchy
of its power for the benefit of
Pompey in the case of the Mani-
lian law. Cf. de Pet. Cons. 4, 53
Sall. Cat. 23 end, and Intr. 4.—
Ianuario . . . Romae sis: the
next letter to Atticus (Att. 1. 12)
was written in 61 B.C. The break
in the correspondence is explained
by the presence of Atticus in Rome
or its vicinity.

III. Rome, Apr., 62 B.C. In
Dec„ 63 B.c. Cicero had sent to
Pompey, who was in the East‚ a
somewhat lengthy letter (now lost),
in which he had given a re'sume' of
the achievements of his consul-

ship. This letter, written proba-

Sed hoc scit0‚ tuos

bly in that egotistical vein which
characterizes many of Cicero’s ut·
terances in regard to his consul-
ship, apparently offended Pompey,

who replied in a brief, unsympa- .

thetic letter. At the same time,
Pompey sent a letter to the senate
containing no word of commen-
dation for Cicero. The letter be-
fore us was written upon the receipt
of these two epistles. For the
formula of greeffing, see Intr. 62.

1. S. t. e. q. v. b. e.: for si tu
exercitusque valetis, bene est ,· a
stereotyped form of salutation
which Cicero uses only in official
or formal letters, or in replying to
some one who has employed ,it in
writing to him. Intr. 62.—pub-
lice, ffcially, to the magistrates
and senate. Cf. Fam. 15. 1.—
tantam . . . spem oti: along with
the carrying out of other projects‚
Pompey had in 64 B.C. reduced
Syria and Cilicia into provinces,
so that his work of subjugation in
the East was practically ended.—
pollicebar: in particular in the
oration for the Manilian law.—
