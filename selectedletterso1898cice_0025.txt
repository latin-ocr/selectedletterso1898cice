INTRODUCTION. xix '

poses of Catiline and his party drove the aristocracy to the
’ support of Cicero, and he was elected by a good majority
with C. Antonius as his colleague.

8. Throughout his consulship Cicero's policy was that of
a moderate member of the senatorial party. He opposed
the proposition made by the tribune, Rullus, to divide the
agerpublicus in Campania; he opposed a measure to relieve
the children of those proscribed by Sulla 3 he defended the
law of Otho which reserved certain seats in the theatre to
the knights; he defended C. Rabirius on the charge of
murder brought against him by the democrats‚1 and he sup-
pressed the Catilinari'an conspiracy3 but it was significant
of the future that, when Cicero retired at the end of this
year of office, the tribune Q. Metellus Nepos sorbade him to
make a parting speech2 on the ground that in punishing
the Catilinarian conspirators he had put Roman citizens to
death without a trial.

9. The year 62 B.C. opened with a series of bitter attacks
upon the senate by Pompey's tool‚ the tribune Metellus
Nepos, supported by the praetor C. Julius Caesar. Against
Cicero, his consulship, and the execution of the conspirators,
Metellus made his fiercest onslaughts,3 but the Optimates
were too strong for their opponents. Metellus fied to Pom-
pey4 for protection and Caesar was forbidden for a time to
administer the duties of his office.5 It was during this
period of political uproar that Cicero delivered one of the
most charming of his orations, in defending the claim· to
citizenship of his old friend and teacher‚ Archias.
