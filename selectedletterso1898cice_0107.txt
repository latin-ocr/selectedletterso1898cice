Att. 1. 16.] CICERO'S LETTERS. 25

puer; obicit mihi me ad Baias fuisse. Falsum, sed
tamen quid huic? ‘Simile est,' inquam, ‘quasi dicas
in operto fuisse.’—‘Quid,' inquit, ‘homini Arpinati
cum aquis calidis? ' ‘ Narra,' inquam, ‘patrono tuo,
qui Arpinatis aquas concupivit’; nosti enim marinas,

appellas,’ inquam,
lam fecerit?'

(Att. 13. 29. 1), and even from
comparatives‚ minusculus (Att. 14.
13. 5), and meliuscule (Att. 4. 6.
2). Cf. also Intr. 76.—ad Baias:
Clodius twits Cicero with living
at the fashionable seaside resort
Baiae, whose reputation for strict-
ness of morals was a little ques-
tionable. Cicero, disdaining to
defend himself, intimates that
Clodius had been found once in
far more suspicious surroundings,
i.e. at the festival of the Bona Dea.
—falsum, sed tamen quid huic
(sc. falsum id esse responderem):
addressed to Atticus, not to Clo-
dius. One of Cicero’s houses
was at Puteoli, so that while he
could technically deny having a
villa at Baiae, he was within the
circle of its influence, as he him-
self felt, for he refers to the place
as Cratera illum delicatum (⁴ Cra-
ter with its well-known allure—
ments ’), Αίΐ. 2. 8. 2.—in operto
(Bonae Deae): a technical phrase,
‘at the mystic rites.'—quid homi-
ni Arpinati curn aquis calidis:
i.e. what business has a country-
man from Arpinum at a water-
ing-place? Cicero replies, ‘Make
that remark to your patron (Curio)
who was terribly anxious for the
springs of a countryrnan from
Arpinum.' The Aquae Arpinatis
were medicinal springs upon an

‘cum Rex tui mentionem ‚nul-
Ille autem Regis hereditatem spe
devorarat. ——‘Domum,’ inquit, ‘emisti'

‘ Putes,' in-

estate once belonging to C. Ma-
rius. Cicero parries the thrust
at his provincialism, therefore,
by referring to the fact that
one of Rome's most illustrious
men lived in his native town Ar-
pinum, and hits Clodius through
Curio, for the latter had obtained
the estate during the Sullan pro-
scriptions‚ and therefore not in an
honorable way. — nosti enim ma-
rinas: addressed to Atticus. These
springs were perhaps called mari-
nae because they were near the
sea-coast.— regem appellas, cum
. . . fecerit, do you talk os a rex,
wlzen Rex made no mention os
you ? Q. Marcius Rex was brother-
in-law of Clodius, and at his death
passed over the latter entirely in
his will. —ille autem, etc.: a par-
enthetica] explanation to Atticus,
as the death of Rex had occurred
very recently.— domum: Cicero's
house was in the most fashionable
part of the city, on the Palatine,
and eost him &Igossoo (Fam. 5. 6.
2). Cf. Intr. 45. Clodius wishes
to characterize Cicero as a par-
venu, and perhaps to suggest that
the money had been obtained in
a questionable way. Gell.12.1 2 tells
us that the money for the purchase
of the house came from P. Cor-
nelius Sulla, who was defended
by Cicero in 62 B.C. —- putes:
