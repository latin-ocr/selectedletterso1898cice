lxiv INTRODUCTION.

added to substantives‚ to adjectiveS, to adverbs, and even
to the comparative form of the adjective and adverb, and
suggests often some emotion on the part of the writer.
Cf. note to pulchellus, Epist. V. 10.

77. Words eempomm'ed willa per· and sub-. Equally com-
mon is the use with adjectives, adverbs, and verbs of the pre-
fixes per· and suff, which respectively strengthen and weaken
the force of the words to which they are attached ; e.g. per-
benivolas (Fam. 14. 4. 6), subirascor, ‘I am a trifle pro-
voked' (Alt. 9. 7. 7). The use of these prefixes is not by
any means unknown in formal literature, but in epistolary
Latin it gives rise to many new and strange compounds, e.g.
pervesperi (Fam. 9. 2. Ι), sabinanis (Aa. 2. 17. 2), and sub-
turpz'calas (Aa. 4. 5.v 1). It is in the freedom with which
such compounds were formed, and the ’frequency with which
they were used, that colloquial Latin was distinguished from
formal Latin. These compounds had gone so far toward
supplanting the simple words in familiar speech that in
some cases they differed in no wise from them, as is shown
in the phrase qaae parcius frater perscmpserat (Q. Cic., Fam.
16. 27. 1). Cf. also note to perlzmmltuose, Epist. XXXIV. 3.

78. Verbs compoundea' witlz ad-, con-‚ ete. In this connec-
tion mention may be made of verbs compounded with ad·, con-,
de-, and {2⁷sz3 which are used in the Letters not only with great
frequency, but often when they do not apparently differ in
meaning from the simple verbs. Compounds with dis· are
especially noteworthy. Cf. note to discupio, Epist. XLVIII. 2.

79. Requentatives. Frequentatives are used with such
freedom, and so often in the double form (eg. ventilo,
Matius, Fam. 11. 28. 7), or with the addition of such words
as saepe or crebro, as, for instance, ostentare crebro solebat
(Dolabella, Fam. 9. 9. 2), that one is at first inclined to
think that the frequentative has lost its characteristic force
in such cases3 but it is more probable that in the double
