INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

The Pompeians, after planning a rendezvous at Luceria,¹
hurried toward Brundisium, whither Pompey peremptorily
summoned Cicero.2 Nevertheless he remained in For-
miae, hoping still to effect a reconciliation between Caesar
and Pompey,³ and, with this hope in mind, he had an
interview with Caesar at Formiae,⁴ Mar. 28. In this inter-
view Caesar requested him to go to Rome and use his
best efforts to secure peace, but when Cicero mentioned
the terms which he should propose, Caesar refused to
accept thern.

30. This meeting put an end to his hesitation. He felt
sure that all hope of a reconciliation was gone, as neither
party would submit terms which the other could accept.
Cicero has been often accused of indecision during this
period, but unjustly so. In his opinion there was right and
wrong with each party, and civil war was an evil to be
avoided at all hazards. He used every possible means,
therefore, to avert the catastrophe, but without success,
Recognizing the inevitable, he cast in his lot with the man
to whom he personally owed most ;> for the choice lay, not
between Caesar and the Republic, but between Caesar and
Pompey3 nec mehercule lzoc facio rei publicae causa, quam

31. On June 7, 49 B.c., Cicero, accompanied by his
brother, his son, and his nephew, sailed from Formiae to
join Pompey near Dyrrachium,⁵ which place he reached,
after stopping for several months on the estate of Atticus
in Epirus, toward the close of the year 49 B.C., some eight
