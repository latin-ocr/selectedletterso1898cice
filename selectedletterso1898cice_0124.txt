42 , CICERO'S LETTERS. [Ep. VII.

turpius apud homines fuisset, neque vero ad istam ip-
sam ἰισφάλειαν quicquam alienius; sunt enirn illi apud
bonos invidiosi, ego apud improbos meam retinuissem
invidiam, alienam adsumpsissem. Caesar me sibi vult
esse legatum. Honestior declinatio haec periculi; sed
ego hoc non repudio, Quid ergo est? Pugnare malo;
nihil tamen certi. Iterum dico: utinam adesses! sed
tamen, si erit necesse, arcessemuS. Quid aliud? quid?
Hoc opinor: certi sumus perisse omnia. Quid enim
ἀκκιζόμεθα tamdiu? Sed haec scripsi properans et
mehercule timide. Posthac ad te aut, si perfidelem
habebo cui dem, scribam plane onmia, aut, si obscure
scribam, tu tamen intelleges. In iis epistulis me Lae-

member of the commission, the
triumvirs should wait until a mem-
ber died, and should then offer
him the chance of stepping into
a dead man's shoes, so to speak.
The phrase implies also that one
holding a place on the commission
would be dead politically.—-is-

Cicero might hope for protection

Cicero elsewhere (Ep. ΙΙΙ. 3) com·
pares himself to Laelius. In his
next letter to Atticus (Att. 2. 20.
3) he announces his intention of
calling himself Laelius in the let-
ters and leaving the name of
Atticus unchanged. The plan
suggested here does not seem to
have been carried out. Furius, con·
