HS. cm cm cm debeat. Dixi hanc legem P. Clodium
iam ante servasse3 pronuntiare enim solitum esse et
non dare. Sed, heus tu! videsne consulatum illum
nostrum, quem Curio antea ἀποθέωσιν vocabat, si hic
factus erit, Fabam Mimum futurum? Quare, ut opinor,
φιλοσοφητέον, id quod tu faciS, et istos consulatus non
flocci facteon. Quod ad me scribis te in Asiam statu-
isse non ire, equidem mallem ut ireS, ac vereor ne
quid in ista re minus commode fiat; sed tamen non
possum reprehendere consilium tuum, praesertim cum

egomet in provinciam non sim profectus

valna—HS. 010 <310 010 ε 3000
sesterces, or more than 312o.00.
As there were 35 tribes, the an-
nual fine would have been over
&tzod—heus tu! a colloquial
exclamation, commonly followed
in Plautus by a command. Cf.
Bacch. 327; cf. also Intr. 92.—
hic: i.e. Afranius—factus erit:
sc. camna—Fabam Mimum: if
the reading is correct, perhaps
Bockel's explanation is the most
plausible one. The mimus (a kind
of farce) was a popular form of
entertainment. One of these farces
well known at Rome was called
the Faba Mimus. Both here
and in the other passage (Seneca,
Ἀποκολοκύντωσις, 9) where the ex-
pression occurs, the writer is speak-
ing on the subject of an apotheo-
sis. Now the Pythagoreans were
the most prominent teachers of
re-incarnation‚ and at the same
time laid down certain rules in re-
gard to the use of beans as an
article of diet. The Faba sllimus
may therefore have been a parody
on the teachings of Pythagoras
upon these two points, and well
known for its wit or nonsense, so
that the meaning of the passage
may be, ‘if Afranius is elected

Epigramma-

consul, that consulship of mine,
which Curio used in mockery to
call an apotheosis, will be the sort
of an apotheosis that one sees in
the ‘Bean Farce,’ for my com-
panion in apotheosis will be this
nobody Afranius.’ See Crit. Ap-
pend. —— ᾡιλοσοῴητὲον, one must
play tlte philosopher. — id quod tu
facis: Atticus throughout his life,
except during Cicero's consul-
ship and his candidacy for that
office, held aloof from politics,
following in this respect the teach-
ings of his school,·the Epicurean.
-facteom a hybrid form, instead
of fila-sendum, suggested by ψιλο-
σ-οῲητὲον, and after the analogy
of the Greek verbal in -τέον with
the accusative after it. Cf. Intr. 74.

14. te in Asiam, etc.: Quintus
Cicero, who was going out to
Asia as propraetor, had invited
his brother-in-law Atticus, to ac-
company him as legatus. cf. Ep.
VI. 7 n. — vereor ne quid, etc.:
Quintus did take umbrage at the
refusal of Atticus. Cicero would
also have gladly seen Atticus go, to
restrain his hot-headed brother. —
cum egomet, etc.: Cicero de-
clined a province at the close of
his consulship.
