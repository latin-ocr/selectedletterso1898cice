VI. CAESAR OR ΡΟΜΡΕΥΡ1

(Aet. 58-59. με. 49—48. Epist. XLII.—LIII.)

26. Cicero, upon his arrival, found political affairs in a
turmoil. The lex Vatinia of 59 13.c. (ἓ 13) had assigned Gallia
Cisalpina and Illyricum to Caesar for a period of five years,
dating from Mar. 1, 59 B.C.² By the lex Pompeia Licinia,
passed in 55 B.C. (ἓ 20), Caesar’s term of office was
extended for a period of five years,—probably, therefore,
to Mar. 1, 49 B.c.3 Special legislation of the year 52 B.C. had
allowed Caesar to sue, in 49 B.c., for the consulship, without
personally attending the canvass (ξ 21). His successor
in the provinces would not naturally begin his term of
office until Jan. 1, 48 B.c., and in accordance with the
regular practice in such cases, Caesar might count upon
holding his provinces until that time, when he would pass
from the provincial government to the consulship at Rome,
and thus avoid the snares which his enemies at Rome would
otherwise have set for him. But to frustrate this plan,
M. Marcellus, the consul, a bitter opponent of Caesar, at-
tempted on Dec. 10, 50 Rc. to induce the senate to pass
the senatus consultum ultimum. F ailing in this, he proceeded
to Naples, and on his own motion requested Pompey to
take charge of the legions near Luceria4 and defend the
state. Pompey accepted the command of the legions.

27. This overt act hastened the course of events. On
Dec. 21 Curio, Caesar’s agent, left Rome to go to Caesar,⁵
and returned in time to present a formal ultimatum (cf.
