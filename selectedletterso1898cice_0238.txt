expressions. To this class impli-
care and explicare, which occur
five times in his six letters, would
seem to belong— optimorum
civium: the troops at Corfinium
were made up of recruits from the
Alban, Marsian, and Paelignian
tern'tory, and represented the most
reliable force in Pompey’s Italian
army. —— his legionibus: in 50 B.C.
the senate required Pompey and
Caesar to furnish one legion each
for use in the Parthian war. Cae-
sar obeyed‚ and Pompey complied
by demanding of Caesar a legion
which he had previously lent him.
Both legions were drawn, there-
fore, from Caesar’s army. They
were not used in the Parthian war,
but were stationed in Italy. Ee-
fore their departure from Caesar’s

camp they had received the gifts
of money which soldiers received
in case of a triumph. This fact,
coupled with their admiration for
their former commander, made
their devotion to the Pompeian
cause doubtful. —- consulibus ε
dat. of advantage.

2. etiam nunc: although the
siege has begun.—explices: cf.
implicet, 1 n.—ad adversarium :
the MSS. do not contain ad, but we
must either insert it or regard its
omission as not unnatural in a let-
ter from Pompey, written in haste.
See Crit. Append. Pompey always
speaks of Caesar as an adversarius
(cf.‚e.g., Att. 8. 12 Β. 1 (bz's); 8. 12
C. 1). Probably the senate had
not technically declared him an
hostis (cf. Schmidt, Briefw. 112).
