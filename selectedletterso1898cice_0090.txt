’ 8 CICERO'S LETTERS.

Ν

[Ep. II.

me auctum scito salva Terentia. Abs te tamdiu nihil
litterarum! Ego de meis ad te rationibus scripsi antea
diligenter. Hoc tempore Catilinam, competitorem
nostrum, defendere cogitamus, ¹ Iudices habemus quos
voluimus, summa accusatoris voluntate. Spem, si ab-
solutus erit, coniunctiorem illum nobis fore in ratione
petitionis; sin aliter acciderit, humaniter feremus. Tuo ,
adventu nobis opus est maturo; nam prorsus summa
hominurn est opinio tuos familiareS, nobiles homineS, ’

of him, see Intr. 54.——scit0, let
me inform you; a favorite expres-
sion borrowed from colloquial
Latin, for introducing a bit of
news. Cf. the use of habeto and sic
habeto, Ep. XXVI. 1 n.—Terentia:
cf. Intr. 52.—abs te . . . ego,
not a word from YOU in so long a
time, while Ι, etc. For abs te,
cf. Ep. Ι. 4 n.—hoc ternpore . . .
cogitamus: it will never be cer-
tainly known whether Cicero did
defend Catiline in 65 B.C. or not,
but this passage certainly indicates
such an intention on his part, and
there is no satisfactory reason for
believing that he did not carry out
his purpose. The fact that Cicero
believed in Catiline's guilt (cf. Ep.
Ι. 1) would not, perhaps, have de-
terred him, as he in later years
undertook the defense of Vatinius,
Gabinius, and C. Antonius, equally
notorious men, under still more
questionable circumstances, when
political considerations‚ as in this
case, made it seem advisable. For
the arguments in support of the
opposite view, cf. Tyrrell, 12. pp.
8, 9.—summa accusatoris vo-
luntate: the charge was brought
by P. Clodius. The accuser had
the right of challenging perempto-
rily a certain number of jurors,
and the phrase quoted above
would indicate that Clodius had

availed himself of this privilege in
rejecting jurors who were likely to
vote for a conviction. If this view
be correct, Clodius was really act-
ing in the interest of Catiline in
bringing the charge, since if Cati-
line were acquitted, he could not
be put on trial again. This meth-
od of protecting criminals, called
praevaricatio, became commonet
in later years (cf. Plin. Epist. 3.
9. 33—35). The method to be
employed in securing an acquittal
for Catiline casts more of a shad-
ow upon Cicero’s honor than the
fact that he intended to undertake
or did undertake the defense.

2. tuos familiares: probably
ironicaL although it is true that
Atticus was intimate with many of
the prominent men in Rome (cf.
Nep. Atticus, 15, 16, 18).—n0-
biles homines . . . fore: refer-
ring probably to the aristocracy

‘as a body3 cf. voluntates nobilium,

Ep. Ι. 2 n, and the following sig-
nificant utterance in regard to the
attitude of the Optimates from
the de Petitione Consulatus, 13,
written by Quintus to his brother
a few months later, noli putare
eos, qni sunt eo lzonore usi, non
videre, tn cnm idem sis adeptus,
qnid dzgrnitatis habiturus sis : eos
vero, qni consularibus fam iliis nati
locum maiorum consecuti non sunt,
